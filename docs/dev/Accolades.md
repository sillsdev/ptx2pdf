# Accolades

This document collects accolades and thanks from folks. I know it is hard to
blow our own trumpet but funders (what funders?) like this kind of thing.

In Tanzania, we have now begun using PTXprint to produce the final trial edition
for checking by the language community during their read through of their New
Testament, before the N.T. gets sent to the typesetter. The product looks very
similar to what will be done by the typesetter, and produces a really good
product. Thank you to all involved in bringing us this excellent tool.

Just wanted to say how impressed I am with PTX print.
What a cool program! I've wrestled with printing/outputting from Paratext
and it was a pain. The Thai script is a small font compared to Western
fonts and so things like the verse numbers or brackets/parentheses always
look way too big and various other issues meant I had to spend a lot of
time after outputing from Paratext to make it look halfway decent - just to
have a draft print! If we found things that needed improving we would make
the changes in Paratext and then I'd have to go through all that rigamarole
again just to print it again.

But PTX is amazing.
It might be the first program I've ever used that has the hover help
pop-ups on every single part of the program to help explain what it means.
That is so helpful!
And the fact that I can change one little parameter and click print and see
what that looks like and go back and forth so quickly is really helpful.

Well done guys!

We published a New Testament earlier this year in a language of Chad (central
Africa) using a very complex tool called XeTeX. We had to use that complex tool
because we had various requirements for the typesetting, like borders around the
page and decorations for the verse numbers, which were even more difficult to
produce with other tools. Well, it just so happens that PTXPrint is built on
this same XeTeX engine, and after a lot of back and forth with the PTXPrint
developers, they were able to implement almost the entire set of requirements
that we had for that typesetting. In fact, this same language also completed the
book of Genesis and wanted to publish a test version of the book this past
month, using basically those same requirements. There were still a few issues
that needed to be resolved with the developers, but in the end, we were able to
produce the PDF for Genesis that was almost the same quality as the NT published
earlier in the year. This is going to be a great time-saver for me, as most of
the complexity of XeTeX is hidden behind the friendly user interface of
PTXPrint. Thank you for your diligent efforts!
