# zimagecopyrights
## Summary
Image copyrights statements, for use in front / back matter.
## Examples
```
\zimagecopyrights
```
## Description
It is important that intellectual property used in a publication is properly acknowledged. PTXprint records the page of each image used and (on the next run)  populates the definition of this command with the appropriate acknowledgement (assuming the copyright information is known or supplied in the piclist entry).

Note that this is not a milestone, so there is no closing mark.
