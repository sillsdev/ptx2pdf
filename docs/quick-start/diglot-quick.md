# Diglot setup instructions. 
(this assumes you know how to make the normal paratext2 side of things work) 

## Make a diglot - friendly .usfm file (or files)
this can be by hand or by using the ```diglot_merge.pl``` perl script.  
Useful commands: ```\lefttext``` ```\righttext``` ```\nolefttext``` ```\norighttext``` This snippet (from `history.usfm` in the examples/diglot directory) shows some of them in action.

```
\lefttext
\s The birth of diglot 
\p
\norighttext
\p
\v 4 David took ptxplus and tweaked it in various places and so diglot came into being, and it lived in dark obscurity for many years, sometimes crafting text, sometimes creating strange things.
\p
\righttext
\p
\v 4 And David took ptxplus and did bend it in diverse places to make diglot.  Diglot dwelt in darkness and created beauty or disaster depending upon many factors.
```
Notice that the  ```\norighttext``` means that the ```\v 4```s should line up, with a space in the right for the section heading.

![ History](../../examples/diglot/history.png  "The above example.")

Setting this up by hand is possible, but rather hard. The easier option is to use the ```diglot_merge.pl``` program. You might want something like:

```
diglot_merge.pl -s -p -L merge.log -o merged.usfm file1.usfm file2.usfm
```
Those options say:

 * -s Spit sections into their own sections
 * -p Use paragraph-by-paragraph matching
 * -L Logging goes to merge.log
 * -o Output goes to merged.usfm
 * The contents of  file1.usfm and file2.usfm go on the left and right respectively.

You can also select a range using ```-R chapter:verse-chaper:verse``` It might work, but it's been a while since it was extensively tested.


## Set up the stylesheet options.
Any given marker ```\thing``` applies to both sides unless it is overridden; marker ```\thingL``` only applies to left column, ```\thingR``` only applies to the right column.  Ptxplus's addition ```\BaseLine``` property should actually work, so you can have different baselines if you need them for your fonts, as well as different faces.

**Make sure that you set** ```\diglottrue``` 
If you plan to use the ```\thingL``` format, you must load the style sheets with ```\diglottrue``` set, even if you then use monoglot text first.

* ```\def\DiglotLeftFraction{0.45}``` % In case texts align better with unequal columns
* ```\def\DiglotRightFraction{0.55}```
You probably want to ensure that the fractions add up to 1! These fractions will probably need tweaking, based on the relative wordiness of the two translations, the font, and so on. 

I'm not sure what else is needed, other than running xetex on your master file. There are more details in the documentation directory.
