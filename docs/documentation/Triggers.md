# Trigger mechanism

In addition to the special-purpose `piclist` and `adjlist` files, there are now
two methods to insert generic USFM mark-up or TeX code into the input.  Both
methods use the same mechanism, indeed the same mechanism is used by piclists
and adjustlits (with some behind-the-scenes modifications) and specially
formatted files. In a `.tex` file (e.g. `ptxprint-mods.tex`), it is possible to add
short pieces of text or code like this:

```\addtrigger{REV20.14-preverse}{\code}```

Which will execute `\code` at the specified trigger point. Note that `\code` here cannot 
include any USFM codes such as `\s1` that contain a number, and nor can it
include any blank lines.

Note that piclists require a space after the book id, but this is deleted in the 
trigger code, and should not be present in `\addtrigger`.

As a more friendly interface, separate trigger files  may be used.  Both job-wide 
(```[jobname].triggers```) and SFM-file specific (e.g.  ```01GENMyTranslation.SFM.triggers```) trigger files are checked. 

If a specification 
```\TrigListPath{Path/to/trigger/files/}```  
has been given, [ if non-empty, it must end with the appropriate path separator (`/` or `\\`). The default is empty.] then that path will also be tried for SFM-file specific trigger lists.

*Also* checked are files of the type 
```[trigger list path]01GENMyTranslation.SFM-1.triggers```,
```[trigger list path]01GENMyTranslation.SFM-2.triggers```, and so on.

If  GEN.usfm-(N).triggers is can be read, GEN.usfm-(N+1).triggers will be tried; if not, processing stops. I.e. the code will not try to read `-3` if there is no `-1` file.

## Additional trigger files
If the above mechanism is insufficient, then further trigger files may
be loaded using 
```
\opentriglist "[path]filename.triggers"
``` to load one file, or
```
\multitriglists "[path]filename"
```
to load multiple files. Note that while ```\opentriglist``` expects a
fully specified filename, which could have a different extension,
```\multitriglists``` always appends a hyphen, a number (starting at
1) and `.triggers`

##  Trigger file format 
``` 
\AddTrigger REV20.14-preverse
\esb
\cat symbols\cat*
\s1 The lake of fire

\p The destruction of death and hades (the place of the dead) in the lake of
fire demonstrates ....
\esbe
\EndTrigger
```

This will create an extended sidebar that will be triggered before the verse
number for `Rev20:14`. Blank lines as in the example above do not trigger an error.

There are three classes of trigger point -- those expecting words, and those expecting 
a block (in-line image or sidebar, or paragraphs of text), and those that
tolerate either well. Either may be used to trigger, say, a side-bar that does
not appear inline, and if the original pararaphing is to be interrupted then
blocks can occur in either.  See later for *inappropriate* uses.

## Milestones and triggers
A stand-alone milestone can normally serves as a trigger point. However, for
some stand-alone milestones that really makes no sense. An example would be the
`\xts` milestone used for Strong's numbers. To suppress the milestone-calling for that 
milestone, the code includes `\NotTriggerPoint{xts}`. Other milestones can be
similarly skipped.
To revert to previous behaviour, `\IsTriggerPoint{xts}` can be specified.

The test to skip triggers *only* affects milestones with their default attribute set. 
Stand-alone milestones with no attribute set always call their triggers. Note that skipping the 
trigger test *also* avoids changing the reference point. I.e. it is not possible to skip 
trigger points on keywords but trigger on the N'th paragraph after a given keyword.

```

## Trigger points expecting blocks (if at start of paragraph) or words
* ```REV20.14-preverse``` Triggers before the verse number. 
* ```GLOk.LakeofFire-preverse``` Triggers before the glossary entry ```\k Lake of Fire\k*```, in the book with id `GLO`
* ```ms:zif```	Triggers before any stand-alone milestone  of type ```zif```, e.g.  ```\zif |file="wombats"\*``` in any book.
* ```ms:zwombat=a542``` Triggers before the unique stand-alone milestone ```\zwombat| id="a542"\*``` in any book.
* ```GENa542``` Triggers before the unique stand-alone milestone ```\zwombat| id="a542"\*``` in Genesis.
* ```XXABorrogroves``` Triggers at any stand-alone milestone with a matching  id (e.g. ```\zfiga|Borrogroves```) in book with id `XXA`.

## Trigger points expecting words.

* ```REV20.14``` Triggers mid-paragraph, after the post-versenumber space.
* ```GLOk.Herrod``` Triggers mid-paragraph, after the glossary entry ```\k Herrod\k*```

## Trigger points only expecting blocks 
NB for all of these (and piclist entries) ```\SetTriggerParagraphSeparator{=@=}``` or similar may be used to define the
separator between the identifier and the paragraph number if ```=``` is somehow inappropriate.

* ```REV20.14=2``` Triggers before any content (including the indent) at the second paragraph of the verse.
* ```GLOk.HerrodTheGreat=2``` Triggers before any content (includin the indent) at the second paragraph of the definition.
* ```ms:zif=2``` Triggers the second paragraph after ```\zif |file="wombats"\*```, if this is in introductory matter or 
after the glossary section, or other book in which the verse counter has not been used.
* ```GLOBorrogroves=3``` Triggers the third paragraph after ```\zfiga |id="Borrogroves"\*```, if this is in introductory matter, after 
the glossary, or in another book in which the verse counter has not been used.


# Considerations in the selecting of a trigger point

Triggers that would insert an inline block (e.g. an image or sidebar with a
pgpos of `h`, or an extra paragraph of text block of text), should 
normally use a trigger point that is not in the middle of a piece of text. 
There is no logic to inspect the contents of a trigger block and thus 
perform contents-appropriate ending paragraphs, etc. 

Similarly, block-expecting trigger points, while they will accept text, may not
be *appropriate* for text. In particular, the trigger point `GEN1.1=2` (2nd
paragraph of that verse) occurs *before* the space that indents the paragraph,
not after it.  This is correct for images, but confusing for words. Inserting a
word there will go in an unindented position, and the indent will occur after
any inserted material.
