"The anchor specifies what page in a book a picture will appear on. It "

"Ref by a few verses to change the page on which it appears.\n"
"\n"
"An Anchor Ref must consist of a book code, perhaps followed by L or R (in "
"the case of a diglot), then a space, then an in-book location which contains "
"a dot (period). In a scripture book, the in-book location is Chap.Verse "
"where the Verse matches the \\v value precisely. In other books, the in-book "
"location can be anything as long as it is unique in that book and contains a "
"dot (period).\n"
