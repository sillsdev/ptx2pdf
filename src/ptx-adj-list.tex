% paragraph adjustment from auxiliary file

% Read a line from the adjustment file; expected format is
%    BBB C.V ADJ [n]
% where BBB is the book code (GEN, EXO, MAT, etc), C.V is the chapter.verse reference
%       ADJ is the paragraph-length adjustment to be applied here (+1, +2, -1, etc)
%       [n] is an optional index of paragraph within the verse, default is 1
%
% The reference of the adjustment to be applied is stored in \@djref, and the actual adjustment in \@djustment.
