\c 1
\s \jmp |link-id="pgtop1"\jmp* \zgry This is a really excessively long title that breaks across two lines\zgry*
\p
\v 1 This is normal text.\f + \fr 1:1 \ft A footnote\f* 
\nd NDtext and other character styles can cross a milestone boundary like this -> \qt-s\* 
now inside an unattributed  qt-s..qt-e block \nd* The end of the ND style returns to what it was before the ND started,
if it doesn't call setfont.
\p The paragraph break  (praise the \nd Lord!\nd*)
\v 2 sets\f + \fr 1:2 \ft in the case that setfont fails\f*  things back to what they 
ought to be before the end of the block ->
\qt-e\* And now out of the unattributed nd block again. Everything ought to be normal\f + \fr 1:2 
\ft For a given value of normal, see \xt 1|TST 1:1\xt*\f*
\p And another paragraph break
\qt-s| James  sid="123"\*
this bit is attributed to James
\qt-e|eid="234"\*
So is this bit, after a non-matching break.
\qt-e|eid="123"\*


\p  We're \rb outside|above\rb* the clever stuff and ought to be back to normal now. But let's do some nesting.

\c 3
\p
\v  1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
\v  2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that
thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou
doest, except God be with him.
\p
\v  3 Jesus answered and said unto him, \qt-s|Jesus\* \+bd Verily, verily,\+bd* I say unto thee, Except a
man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\qt-e\*
\v  4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he
enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
\v  5 Jesus answered,
\qt-s|Jesus\*
\p  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
\v  6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit is \jmp |link-id="Spirit"\jmp*spirit.
\v  7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
\v  8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but
canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is
born of the Spirit.\qt-e\*
\p
\v  9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

\p I want paragraph 3 as a normal pargraph
