\mt1 THE WISDOM OF JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH, 
\mt2 OR 
\mt1 ECCLESIASTICUS 
\ip \bk The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach\bk*, also called \bk Ecclesiasticus\bk*, is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. 
\is1 The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. 
\ip WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered to us by the law and the prophets, and by the others that have followed in their steps, for which we must give Israel the praise for instruction and wisdom; and since not only the readers need to become skillful themselves, but also those who love learning must be able to profit those who are outside, both by speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books of our fathers, and having gained great familiarity with them, was also drawn on himself to write somewhat pertaining to instruction and wisdom, in order that those who love learning, and are devoted to these things, might make progress much more by living according to the law. You are entreated therefore to read with favor and attention, and to pardon us, if in any parts of what we have labored to interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally spoken in Hebrew don’t have the same force in them when they are translated into another language. Not only these, but the law itself, and the prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their original language. For having come into Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I found a copy giving no small instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to translate this book, applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the book to an end and publish for them also, who in the land of their travels are desiring to learn, preparing their character in advance, so as to live according to the law.

\v 1 All wisdom comes from the Lord, 
\q2 and is with him forever. 
\q1
\v 2 Who can count the sand of the seas, 
\q2 the drops of rain, 
\q2 and the days of eternity? 
\q1
\v 3 Who will search out the height of the sky, 
\q2 the breadth of the earth, the deep, 
\q2 and wisdom? 
\q1
\v 4 Wisdom has been created before all things, 
\q2 and the understanding of prudence from everlasting. 
\v 5  \f + \fr 1:5  \ft Verse 5 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa The source of wisdom is God’s word in the highest heaven, and her ways are the eternal commandments.\f* 
\q1
\v 6 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? 
\q2 Who has known her shrewd counsels? 
\v 7  \f + \fr 1:7  \ft Verse 7 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa To whom was the knowledge of wisdom manifested? Who has understood her abundant experience?\f* 
\q1
\v 8 There is one wise, greatly to be feared, 
\q2 sitting upon his throne: the Lord. 
\q1
\v 9 He created her. 
\q2 He saw and measured her. 
\q2 He poured her out upon all his works. 
\q1
\v 10 She is with all flesh according to his gift. 
\q2 He gave her freely to those who love him. 
\q1
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation, 
\q2 and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. 
\q1
\v 12 The fear of the Lord will delight the heart, 
\q2 and will give gladness, joy, and length of days. 
\q1
\v 13 Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last. 
\q2 He will be blessed in the day of his death. 
\q1
\v 14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. 
\q2 It was created together with the faithful in the womb. 
\q1
\v 15 She\f + \fr 1:15  \ft Gr. \fqa nested. \f* laid an eternal foundation with men. 
\q2 She will be trusted among their offspring. 
\q1
\v 16 To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom. 
\q2 She inebriates men with her fruits. 
\q1
\v 17 She will fill all her house with desirable things, 
\q2 and her storehouses with her produce. 
\q1
\v 18 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, 
\q2 making peace and\f + \fr 1:18  \ft Gr. \fqa health of cure. \f* perfect health to flourish.\f + \fr 1:18  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa Both are gifts of God for peace; glory opens out for those who love him. He saw her and took her measure.\f* 
\q1
\v 19 He both saw and measured her. 
\q2 He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding, 
\q2 and exalted the honor of those who hold her fast. 
\q1
\v 20 To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom. 
\q2 Her branches are length of days. 
\v 21  \f + \fr 1:21  \ft Verse 21 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa The fear of the Lord drives away sins. Where it resides, it will turn away all anger. \f* 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Unjust wrath can never be justified, 
\q2 for the sway of his wrath is his downfall. 
\q1
\v 23 A man that is patient will resist for a season, 
\q2 and afterward gladness will spring up to him. 
\q1
\v 24 He will hide his words for a season, 
\q2 and the lips of many will tell of his understanding. 
\q1
\v 25 A parable of knowledge is in the treasures of wisdom; 
\q2 but godliness is an abomination to a sinner. 
\q1
\v 26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments 
\q2 and the Lord will give her to you freely; 
\q1
\v 27 for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction. 
\q2 Faith and humility are his good pleasure. 
\q1
\v 28 Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord. 
\q2 Don’t come to him with a double heart. 
\q1
\v 29 Don’t be a hypocrite in the mouths of men. 
\q2 Keep watch over your lips. 
\q1
\v 30 Don’t exalt yourself, 
\q2 lest you fall and bring dishonor upon your soul. 
\q1 The Lord will reveal your secrets 
\q2 and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation, 
\q2 because you didn’t come to the fear of the Lord 
\q2 and your heart was full of deceit. 
\b
\c 2  
\q1
\v 1 My son, if you come to serve the Lord, 
\q2 prepare your soul for temptation. 
\q1
\v 2 Set your heart aright, constantly endure, 
\q2 and don’t make haste in time of calamity. 
\q1
\v 3 Cling to him, and don’t depart, 
\q2 that you may be increased at your latter end. 
\q1
\v 4 Accept whatever is brought upon you, 
\q2 and be patient when you suffer humiliation. 
\q1
\v 5 For gold is tried in the fire, 
\q2 and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. 
\q1
\v 6 Put your trust in him, and he will help you. 
\q2 Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 All you who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy. 
\q2 Don’t turn aside, lest you fall. 
\q1
\v 8 All you who fear the Lord, put your trust in him, 
\q2 and your reward will not fail. 
\q1
\v 9 All you who fear the Lord, hope for good things, 
\q2 and for eternal gladness and mercy. 
\q1
\v 10 Look at the generations of old, and see: 
\q2 Who ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed? 
\q2 Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken? 
\q2 Or who called upon him, and he despised him? 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy. 
\q2 He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Woe to fearful hearts, to faint hands, 
\q2 and to the sinner that goes two ways! 
\q1
\v 13 Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe. 
\q2 Therefore it won’t be defended. 
\q1
\v 14 Woe to you who have lost your patience! 
\q2 And what will you all do when the Lord visits you? 
\q1
\v 15 Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words. 
\q2 Those who love him will keep his ways. 
\q1
\v 16 Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure. 
\q2 Those who love him will be filled with the law. 
\q1
\v 17 Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, 
\q2 and will humble their souls in his sight. 
\q1
\v 18 We will fall into the hands of the Lord, 
\q2 and not into the hands of men; 
\q1 for as his majesty is, 
\q2 so also is his mercy. 
\b
\c 3  
\q1
\v 1 Hear me, your father, O my children, 
\q2 and do what you hear, that you all may be saved. 
\q1
\v 2 For the Lord has given the father glory concerning the children, 
\q2 and has confirmed the judgement of the mother concerning the sons. 
\q1
\v 3 He who honors his father will make atonement for sins. 
\q2
\v 4 He that gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure. 
\q1
\v 5 Whoever honors his father will have joy in his own children. 
\q2 He will be heard in the day of his prayer. 
\q1
\v 6 He who gives glory to his father will have length of days. 
\q2 He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother, 
\q1
\v 7  \f + \fr 3:7  \ft Some manuscripts add \fqa those who fear the Lord honor their father,\f* and will serve under his parents, as to masters. 
\q1
\v 8 Honor your father in deed and word, 
\q2 that a blessing may come upon you from him. 
\q1
\v 9 For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children, 
\q2 but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonor of your father, 
\q2 for your father’s dishonor is no glory to you. 
\q1
\v 11 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father, 
\q2 and a mother in dishonor is a reproach to her children. 
\q1
\v 12 My son, help your father in his old age, 
\q2 and don’t grieve him as long as he lives. 
\q1
\v 13 If he fails in understanding, have patience with him. 
\q2 Don’t dishonor him in your full strength. 
\q1
\v 14 For the relieving of your father will not be forgotten. 
\q2 Instead of sins it will be added to build you up. 
\q1
\v 15 In the day of your affliction it will remember you, 
\q2 as fair weather upon ice, 
\q2 so will your sins also melt away. 
\q1
\v 16 He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer. 
\q2 He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 My son, go on with your business in humility; 
\q2 so you will be loved by an acceptable man. 
\q1
\v 18 The greater you are, humble yourself the more, 
\q2 and you will find favor before the Lord. 
\v 19  \f + \fr 3:19  \ft Some manuscripts add \fqa Many are lofty and renowned, but he reveals his secrets to the humble.\f* 
\q1
\v 20 For the power of the Lord is great, 
\q2 and he is glorified by those who are lowly. 
\q1
\v 21 Don’t seek things that are too hard for you, 
\q2 and don’t search out things that are above your strength. 
\q1
\v 22 Think about the things that have been commanded you, 
\q2 for you have no need of the things that are secret. 
\q1
\v 23 Don’t be overly busy in your superfluous works, 
\q2 for more things are showed to you than men can understand. 
\q1
\v 24 For the conceit of many has led them astray. 
\q2 Evil opinion has caused their judgement to slip. 
\q1
\v 25  \f + \fr 3:25  \ft Some manuscripts omit verse 25.\f*There is no light without eyes. 
\q2 There is no wisdom without knowledge. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 A stubborn heart will do badly at the end. 
\q2 He who loves danger will perish in it. 
\q1
\v 27 A stubborn heart will be burdened with troubles. 
\q2 The sinner will heap sin upon sins. 
\q1
\v 28 The calamity of the proud is no healing, 
\q2 for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him. 
\q1
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable. 
\q2 A wise man desires the ear of a listener. 
\q1
\v 30 Water will quench a flaming fire; 
\q2 almsgiving will make atonement for sins. 
\q1
\v 31 He who repays good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward. 
\q2 In the time of his falling he will find a support. 
\b
\c 4  
\q1
\v 1 My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living. 
\q2 Don’t make the needy eyes wait long. 
\q1
\v 2 Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful, 
\q2 or provoke a man in his distress. 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked. 
\q2 Don’t put off giving to him who is in need. 
\q1
\v 4 Don’t reject a suppliant in his affliction. 
\q2 Don’t turn your face away from a poor man. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t turn your eye away from one who asks. 
\q2 Give no occasion to a man to curse you. 
\q1
\v 6 For if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q2 he who made him will hear his supplication. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Endear yourself to the assembly. 
\q2 Bow your head to a great man. 
\q1
\v 8 Incline your ear to a poor man. 
\q2 Answer him with peaceful words in humility. 
\q1
\v 9 Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of him that wrongs him; 
\q2 Don’t be faint-hearted in giving judgement. 
\q1
\v 10 Be as a father to the fatherless, 
\q2 and like a husband to their mother. 
\q1 So you will be as a son of the Most High, 
\q2 and he will love you more than your mother does. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Wisdom exalts her sons, 
\q2 and takes hold of those who seek her. 
\q1
\v 12 He who loves her loves life. 
\q2 Those who seek her early will be filled with gladness. 
\q1
\v 13 He who holds her fast will inherit glory. 
\q2 Where\f + \fr 4:13  \ft Or, \fqa she \f* he enters, the Lord will bless. 
\q1
\v 14 Those who serve her minister to the Holy One. 
\q2 The Lord loves those who love her. 
\q1
\v 15 He who gives ear to her will judge the nations. 
\q2 He who heeds her will dwell securely. 
\q1
\v 16 If he trusts her, he will inherit her, 
\q2 and his generations will possess her. 
\q1
\v 17 For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways, 
\q2 and will bring fear and dread upon him, 
\q2 and torment him with her discipline, 
\q2 until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgments. 
\q1
\v 18 Then she will return him again to the straight way, 
\q2 and will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets. 
\q1
\v 19 If he goes astray, she will forsake him, 
\q2 and hand him over to his fall. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil. 
\q2 Don’t be ashamed of your soul. 
\q1
\v 21 For there is a shame that brings sin, 
\q2 and there is a shame that is glory and grace. 
\q1
\v 22 Don’t show partiality against your soul. 
\q2 Don’t revere any man to your falling. 
\q1
\v 23 Don’t refrain from speaking when it is for safety. 
\q2 \f + \fr 4:23  \ft Some manuscripts omit this line. \f*Don’t hide your wisdom for the sake of seeming fair. 
\q1
\v 24 For wisdom will be known by speech, 
\q2 and instruction by the word of the tongue. 
\q1
\v 25 Don’t speak against the truth 
\q1 and be shamed for your ignorance. 
\q1
\v 26 Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins. 
\q2 Don’t fight the river’s current. 
\q1
\v 27 Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon. 
\q2 Don’t be partial to one that is mighty. 
\q1
\v 28 Strive for the truth to death, 
\q2 and the Lord God will fight for you. 
\b
\q1
\v 29 Don’t be hasty with your tongue, 
\q2 or slack and negligent in your deeds. 
\q1
\v 30 Don’t be like a lion in your house, 
\q2 or suspicious of your servants. 
\q1
\v 31 Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive, 
\q2 and closed when you should repay. 
\c 5  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t set your heart upon your goods. 
\q2 Don’t say, “They are sufficient for me.” 
\q1
\v 2 Don’t follow your own mind and your strength 
\q2 to walk in the desires of your heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?” 
\q2 for the Lord will surely take vengeance on you. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?” 
\q2 for the Lord is patient. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t be so confident of atonement 
\q2 that you add sin upon sins. 
\q1
\v 6 Don’t say, “His compassion is great. 
\q2 He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,” 
\q2 for mercy and wrath are with him, 
\q2 and his indignation will rest on sinners. 
\q1
\v 7 Don’t wait to turn to the Lord. 
\q2 Don’t put off from day to day; 
\q2 for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you, 
\q2 and you will perish in the time of vengeance. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Don’t set your heart upon unrighteous gains, 
\q2 for you will profit nothing in the day of calamity. 
\q1
\v 9 Don’t winnow with every wind. 
\q2 Don’t walk in every path. 
\q2 This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does. 
\q1
\v 10 Be steadfast in your understanding. 
\q2 Let your speech be consistent. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Be swift to hear 
\q2 and answer with patience. 
\q1
\v 12 If you have understanding, answer your neighbor; 
\q2 but if not, put your hand over your mouth. 
\q1
\v 13 Glory and dishonor is in talk. 
\q2 A man’s tongue may be his downfall. 
\q1
\v 14 Don’t be called a whisperer. 
\q2 Don’t lie in wait with your tongue; 
\q2 for shame is on the thief, 
\q2 and an evil condemnation is on him who has a double tongue. 
\q1
\v 15 Don’t be ignorant in a great or small matter. 
\c 6  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t become an enemy instead of a friend; 
\q2 for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach. 
\q2 So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul, 
\q2 that your soul be not torn in pieces as a bull. 
\q1
\v 3 You will eat up your leaves, destroy your fruit, 
\q2 and leave yourself as a dry tree. 
\q1
\v 4 A wicked soul will destroy him who has it, 
\q2 and will make him a laughing stock to his enemies. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Sweet words will multiply a man’s friends. 
\q2 A gracious tongue will multiply courtesies. 
\q1
\v 6 Let those that are at peace with you be many, 
\q2 but your advisers one of a thousand. 
\q1
\v 7 If you want to gain a friend, get him in a time of testing, 
\q2 and don’t be in a hurry to trust him. 
\q1
\v 8 For there is a friend just for an occasion. 
\q2 He won’t continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q1
\v 9 And there is a friend who turns into an enemy. 
\q2 He will discover strife to your reproach. 
\q1
\v 10 And there is a friend who is a companion at the table, 
\q2 but he won’t continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q1
\v 11 In your prosperity he will be as yourself, 
\q2 and will be bold over your servants. 
\q1
\v 12 If you are brought low, he will be against you, 
\q2 and will hide himself from your face. 
\q1
\v 13 Separate yourself from your enemies, 
\q2 and beware of your friends. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong defense. 
\q2 He who has found him has found a treasure. 
\q1
\v 15 There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend. 
\q2 His excellency is beyond price. 
\q1
\v 16 A faithful friend is a life-saving medicine. 
\q2 Those who fear the Lord will find him. 
\q1
\v 17 He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly; 
\q2 for as he is, so is his neighbor also. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 My son, gather instruction from your youth up. 
\q2 Even when you have gray hair you will find wisdom. 
\q1
\v 19 Come to her as one who plows and sows 
\q2 and wait for her good fruit; 
\q1 for your toil will be little in her tillage, 
\q2 and you will soon eat of her fruit. 
\q1
\v 20 How exceedingly harsh she is to the unlearned! 
\q2 He who is without understanding will not remain in her. 
\q1
\v 21 She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial. 
\q2 He won’t hesitate to cast her from him. 
\q1
\v 22 For wisdom is according to her name. 
\q1 She isn’t manifest to many. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Give ear, my son, and accept my judgement. 
\q2 Don’t refuse my counsel. 
\q1
\v 24 Bring your feet into her fetters, 
\q2 and your neck into her chain. 
\q1
\v 25 Put your shoulder under her and bear her. 
\q2 Don’t be grieved with her bonds. 
\q1
\v 26 Come to her with all your soul. 
\q2 Keep her ways with your whole power. 
\q1
\v 27 Search and seek, and she will be made known to you. 
\q2 When you get hold of her, don’t let her go. 
\q1
\v 28 For at the last you will find her rest; 
\q2 and she will be turned for you into gladness. 
\q1
\v 29 Her fetters will be to you for a covering of strength, 
\q2 and her chains for a robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament upon her, 
\q2 and her bands are \x + \xo 6:30  \xt Numbers 15:38\x* a blue ribbon. 
\q1
\v 31 You shall put her on as a robe of glory, 
\q2 and shall put her on as a crown of rejoicing. 
\b
\q1
\v 32 My son, if you are willing, you will be instructed. 
\q2 If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent. 
\q1
\v 33 If you love to hear, you will receive. 
\q2 If you incline your ear, you will be wise. 
\q1
\v 34 Stand in the multitude of the elders. 
\q2 Attach yourself to whoever is wise. 
\q1
\v 35 Be willing to listen to every godly discourse. 
\q2 Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you. 
\q1
\v 36 If you see a man of understanding, get to him early. 
\q2 Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors. 
\q1
\v 37 Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord 
\q2 and meditate continually on his commandments. 
\q1 He will establish your heart 
\q2 and your desire for wisdom will be given to you. 
\b
\c 7  
\q1
\v 1 Do no evil, 
\q2 so no evil will overtake you. 
\q1
\v 2 Depart from wrong, 
\q2 and it will turn away from you. 
\q1
\v 3 My son, don’t sow upon the furrows of unrighteousness, 
\q2 and you won’t reap them sevenfold. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Don’t seek preeminence from the Lord, 
\q2 nor the seat of honor from the king. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t justify yourself in the presence of the Lord, 
\q2 and don’t display your wisdom before the king. 
\q1
\v 6 Don’t seek to be a judge, 
\q2 lest you not be able to take away iniquities, 
\q2 lest perhaps you fear the person of a mighty man, 
\q2 and lay a stumbling block in the way of your uprightness. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Don’t sin against the multitude of the city. 
\q2 Don’t cast yourself down in the crowd. 
\q1
\v 8 Don’t commit a sin twice, 
\q2 for even in one you will not be unpunished. 
\q1
\v 9 Don’t say, “He will look upon the multitude of my gifts. 
\q2 When I make an offering to the Most High God, he will accept it.” 
\q1
\v 10 Don’t be faint-hearted in your prayer. 
\q2 Don’t neglect to give alms. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Don’t laugh a man to scorn when he is in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q2 for there is one who humbles and exalts.

\v 6 There is none more evil than he who is stingy with himself. 
\q2 This is a punishment for his wickedness.

\v 7 Even if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness.

\v 8 A miser is evil.

\v 9 A covetous man’s eye is not satisfied with his portion.

\v 11 My son, according to what you have, treat yourself well,

\v 12 Remember that death will not wait,

\q1
\v 13 Do good to your friend before you die. 
\q2 According to your ability, reach out and give to him.

\v 14 Don’t defraud yourself of a good day. 
\q2 Don’t let the portion of a good desire pass you by. 
\q1
\v 15 Won’t you leave your labors to another, 
\q2 and your toils be divided by lot? 
\q1
\v 16 Give, take, and treat yourself well, 
\q2 because there is no seeking of luxury in Hades. 
\q1
\v 17 All flesh grows old like a garment, 
\q2 for the covenant from the beginning is, “You must die.” 
\q1
\v 18 Like the leaves flourishing on a thick tree, 
\q2 some it sheds, and some grow, 
\q1 so also are the generations of flesh and blood:

\v 22 Go after her like one who tracks, 
\q2 and lie in wait in her ways. 
\q1
\v 23 He who pries in at her windows 
\q2 will also listen at her doors. 
\q1
\v 24 He who lodges close to her house 
\q2 will also fasten a nail in her walls. 
\q1
\v 25 He will pitch his tent near at hand to her, 
\q2 and will lodge in a lodging where good things are. 
\q1
\v 26 He will set his children under her shelter, 
\q2 and will rest under her branches. 
\q1
\v 27 By her he will be covered from heat, 
\q2 and will lodge in her glory. 
\c 15  
\q1
\v 1 He who fears the Lord will do this. 
\q2 He who has possession of the law will obtain her. 
\q1
\v 2 As a mother shall she meet him, 
\q2 and receive him as a wife married in her virginity. 
\q1
\v 3 She will feed him with bread of understanding 
\q2 and give him water of wisdom to drink. 
\q1
\v 4 He will be stayed upon her, and will not be moved. 
\q2 He will rely upon her, and will not be confounded. 
\q1
\v 5 She will exalt him above his neighbors. 
\q2 She will open his mouth in the midst of the congregation. 
\q1
\v 6 He will inherit joy, a crown of gladness, 
\q2 and an everlasting name. 
\q1
\v 7 Foolish men will not obtain her. 
\q2 Sinners will not see her. 
\q1
\v 8 She is far from pride. 
\q2 Liars will not remember her. 
\q1
\v 9 Praise is not attractive in the mouth of a sinner;

\q1
\v 10 For praise will be spoken in wisdom; 
\q2 The Lord will prosper it. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Don’t say, “It is through the Lord that I fell away;” 
\q2 for you shall not do the things that he hates. 
\q1
\v 12 Don’t say, “It is he that caused me to err;” 
\q2 for he has no need of a sinful man. 
\q1
\v 13 The Lord hates every abomination; 
\q2 and those who fear him don’t love them. 
\q1
\v 14 He himself made man from the beginning 
\q2 and left him in the hand of his own counsel. 
\q1
\v 15 If you will, you shall keep the commandments. 
\q2 To be faithful is good pleasure. 
\q1
\v 16 He has set fire and water before you. 
\q2 You will stretch forth your hand to whichever you desire. 
\q1
\v 17 Before man is life and death. 
\q2 Whichever he likes, it will be given to him. 
\q1
\v 18 For great is the wisdom of the Lord. 
\q2 He is mighty in power, and sees all things. 
\q1
\v 19 His eyes are upon those who fear him. 
\q2 He knows every work of man. 
\q1
\v 20 He has not commanded any man to be ungodly. 
\q2 He has not given any man license to sin.

\v 2 If they multiply, don’t delight in them

\q1
\v 3 Don’t trust in their life. 
\q2 Don’t rely on their condition: 
\q2 for one is better than a thousand, 
\q2 and to die childless than to have ungodly children. 
\q1
\v 4 For from one who has understanding, a city will be populated, 
\q2 but a race of wicked men will be made desolate. 
\q1
\v 5 I have seen many such things with my eyes. 
\q2 My ear has heard mightier things than these.

\q1
\v 6 In the congregation of sinners, a fire will be kindled. 
\q2 In a disobedient nation, wrath is kindled.

\v 7 He was not pacified toward the giants of old time, 
\q2 who revolted in their strength. 
\q1
\v 8 He didn’t spare Lot’s neighbors, 
\q2 whom he abhorred for their pride. 
\q1
\v 9 He didn’t pity the people of perdition 
\q2 who were taken away in their sins, 
\q2
\v 10 or in like manner, the six hundred thousand footmen 
\q2 who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. 
\q1
\v 11 Even if there is one stiff-necked person, 
\q2 it is a marvel if he will be unpunished, 
\q2 for mercy and wrath are both with him who is mighty to forgive, 
\q2 and he pours out wrath. 
\q1
\v 12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also. 
\q2 He judges a man according to his works. 
\q1
\v 13 The sinner will not escape with plunder. 
\q2 The perseverance of the godly will not be frustrated. 
\q1
\v 14 He will make room for every work of mercy.

\q2 the Lord will prepare him for the sword! 
\b
\q1
\v 29 It is difficult for a merchant to keep himself from wrong doing, 
\q2 and for a retailer to be acquitted of sin. 
\c 27  
\q1
\v 1 Many have sinned for profit. 
\q2 He who seeks to multiply wealth will turn his eye away. 
\q1
\v 2 As a nail will stick fast between the joinings of stones, 
\q2 so sin will thrust itself in between buying and selling. 
\q1
\v 3 Unless a person holds on diligently to the fear of the Lord, 
\q2 his house will be overthrown quickly. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains, 
\q2 so does the filth of man in his thoughts. 
\q1
\v 5 The furnace tests the potter’s vessels; 
\q2 so the test of a person is in his thoughts. 
\q1
\v 6 The fruit of a tree discloses its cultivation, 
\q2 so is the utterance of the thought of a person’s heart. 
\q1
\v 7 Praise no man before you hear his thoughts, 
\q2 for this is how people are tested. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 If you follow righteousness, you will obtain her, 
\q1 And put her on, as a long robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 9 Birds will return to their own kind, 
\q2 so truth will return to those who practice it. 
\q1
\v 10 The lion lies in wait for prey. 
\q2 So does sin for those who do evil. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 The discourse of a godly man is always wisdom, 
\q2 but the fool changes like the moon. 
\q1
\v 12 Limit your time among people void of understanding, 
\q2 but persevere among the thoughtful. 
\q1
\v 13 The talk of fools is offensive. 
\q2 Their laughter is wantonly sinful. 
\q1
\v 14 Their talk with much swearing makes hair stand upright. 
\q2 Their strife makes others plug their ears. 
\q1
\v 15 The strife of the proud leads to bloodshed. 
\q2 Their abuse of each other is a grievous thing to hear. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 He who reveals secrets destroys trust, 
\q2 and will not find a close friend. 
\q1
\v 17 Love a friend, and keep faith with him; 
\q2 but if you reveal his secrets, 
\q2 you shall not follow him; 
\q1
\v 18 for as a man has destroyed his enemy, 
\q2 so you have destroyed the friendship of your neighbor. 
\q1
\v 19 As a bird which you have released out of your hand, 
\q2 so you have let your neighbor go, and you will not catch him again: 
\q1
\v 20 Don’t pursue him, for he has gone far away, 
\q2 and has escaped like a gazelle out of the snare. 
\q1
\v 21 For a wound may be bound up, and after abuse there may be reconciliation; 
\q2 but he who reveals secrets has lost hope. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 One who winks the eye contrives evil things; 
\q2 no one will remove him from it. 
\q1
\v 23 When you are present, he will speak sweetly, 
\q2 and will admire your words; 
\q2 but afterward he will twist his speech 
\q2 and set a trap in your words. 
\q1
\v 24 I have hated many things, but nothing like him. 
\q2 The Lord will hate him. 
\b
\q1
\v 25 One who casts a stone on high casts it on his own head. 
\q2 A deceitful blow opens wounds. 
\q1
\v 26 He who digs a pit will fall into it. 
\q2 He who sets a snare will be caught in it. 
\q1
\v 27 He who does evil things, they will roll back upon him, 
\q2 and he will not know where they came from. 
\q1
\v 28 Mockery and reproach are from the arrogant. 
\q2 Vengeance lies in wait for them like a lion. 
\q1
\v 29 Those who rejoice at the fall of the godly will be caught in a snare. 
\q2 Anguish will consume them before they die. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 Wrath and anger, these also are abominations. 
\q2 A sinner will possess them. 
\c 28  
\q1
\v 1 He who takes vengeance will find vengeance from the Lord, 
\q2 and he will surely make his sins firm. 
\q1
\v 2 Forgive your neighbor the hurt that he has done, 
\q2 and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray. 
\q1
\v 3 Does anyone harbor anger against another 
\q2 and expect healing from the Lord? 
\q1
\v 4 Upon a man like himself he has no mercy, 
\q2 and does he make supplication for his own sins? 
\q1
\v 5 He being himself flesh nourishes wrath. 
\q2 Who will make atonement for his sins? 
\q1
\v 6 Remember your last end, and stop enmity. 
\q2 Remember corruption and death, and remain in the commandments. 
\q1
\v 7 Remember the commandments, and don’t be angry with your neighbor. 
\q2 Remember the covenant of the Highest, and overlook ignorance. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Abstain from strife, and you will diminish your sins; 
\q2 for a passionate man will kindle strife. 
\q1
\v 9 Aman who is a sinner will trouble friends, 
\q2 and sow discord among those who are at peace. 
\q1
\v 10 As is the fuel of the fire, so will it burn; 
\q2 and as the stoutness of the strife is, so will it burn. 
\q1 As is the strength of the man, so will be his wrath; 
\q2 and as is his wealth, so he will exalt his anger. 
\q1
\v 11 A contention begun in haste kindles a fire; 
\q2 and hasty fighting sheds blood. 
\q1
\v 12 If you blow a spark, it will burn; 
\q2 and if you spit upon it, it will be quenched. 
\q2 Both of these come out of your mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Curse the whisperer and double-tongued, 
\q2 for he has destroyed many who were at peace. 
\q1
\v 14 A slanderer has shaken many, 
\q2 and dispersed them from nation to nation. 
\q1 It has pulled down strong cities 
\q2 and overthrown the houses of great men. 
\q1
\v 15 A slanderer has cast out brave women 
\q2 and deprived them of their labors. 
\q1
\v 16 He who listens to it will not find rest, 
\q2 nor will he live quietly. 
\q1
\v 17 The stroke of a whip makes a mark in the flesh, 
\q2 but the stroke of a tongue will break bones. 
\q1
\v 18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, 
\q2 yet not so many as those who have fallen because of the tongue. 
\q1
\v 19 Happy is he who is sheltered from it, 
\q2 who has not passed through its wrath, 
\q2 who has not drawn its yoke, 
\q2 and has not been bound with its bands. 
\q1
\v 20 For its yoke is a yoke of iron, 
\q2 and its bands are bands of brass. 
\q1
\v 21 Its death is an evil death, 
\q2 and Hades is better than it. 
\q1
\v 22 It will not have rule over godly men. 
\q2 They will not be burned in its flame. 
\q1
\v 23 Those who forsake the Lord will fall into it. 
\q2 It will burn among them, and won’t be quenched. 
\q1 It will be sent against them like a lion. 
\q2 It will destroy them like a leopard. 
\q1
\v 24 Look that you hedge your possession about with thorns, 
\q2 and secure your silver and your gold; 
\q1
\v 25 So make a balance and a weight for your words, 
\q2 and make a door and a bar for your mouth. 
\q1
\v 26 Take heed lest you slip with it, 
\q2 lest you fall before one who lies in wait.

\q1
\v 1 He that shows mercy will lend to his neighbor; 
\q1 And he that strengthens him with his hand keeps the commandments. 
\q1
\v 2 Lend to your neighbor in time of his need; 
\q1 And pay you your neighbor again in due season. 
\q1
\v 3 Confirm your word, and keep faith with him; 
\q1 And at all seasons you shall find what you need. 
\q1
\v 4 Many have reckoned a loan as a windfall, 
\q1 And have given trouble to those that helped them. 
\q1
\v 5 Till he has received, he will kiss a man’s hands; 
\q1 And for his neighbor’s money he will speak submissly: 
\q1 And when payment is due, he will prolong the time, 
\q1 And return words of heaviness, and complain of\f + \fr 29:5  \ft Gr. \fqa the season. \f* the times. 
\q1
\v 6 If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half; 
\q1 And he will count it as a windfall: 
\q1 If not, he has deprived him of his money, 
\q1 And he has gotten him for an enemy without cause: 
\q1 He will pay him with cursing and railing; 
\q1 And for honor he will pay him disgrace. 
\q1
\v 7  \f + \fr 29:7  \ft Some ancient authorities read \fqa Many therefore. \f* Many on account of \add men’s \add* ill-dealing have turned away; 
\q1 They have feared to be defrauded for nothing. 
\q1
\v 8 However with a man in poor estate be patient; 
\q1 And let him not wait for \add your \add* alms. 
\q1
\v 9 Help a poor man for the commandment’s sake; 
\q1 And according to his need send him not empty away. 
\q1
\v 10 Lose \add your \add* money for a brother and a friend; 
\q1 And let it not rust under the stone to be lost. 
\q1
\v 11 Bestow your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High; 
\q1 And it shall profit you more than gold. 
\q1
\v 12 Shut up alms in your store-chambers;

\q1
\v 13 It shall fight for you against your enemy 
\q1 Better than a mighty shield and a ponderous spear. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 A good man will be surety for his neighbor; 
\q1 And he that has lost shame will fail him. 
\q1
\v 15 Forget not the good offices of your surety; 
\q1 For he has given his life for you. 
\q1
\v 16 A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety; 
\q1
\v 17 And he that is of an unthankful mind will fail him that delivered him. 
\q1
\v 18 Suretiship has undone many that were prospering, 
\q1 And shaken them as a wave of the sea: 
\q1 Mighty men has it driven from their homes; 
\q1 And they wandered among strange nations. 
\q1
\v 19 A sinner that falls into suretiship, 
\q1 And undertakes contracts for work, shall fall into lawsuits. 
\q1
\v 20 Help your neighbor according to your power,

\q1
\v 21 The chief thing for life is water, and bread,

\q1
\v 22 Better is the life of a poor man under a shelter of logs, 
\q1 Than sumptuous fare in another man’s house. 
\q1
\v 23 With little or with much, be well satisfied.\f + \fr 29:23  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 24 It is a miserable life to go from house to house: 
\q1 And where you are a sojourner, you shall not \add dare to \add* open your mouth. 
\q1
\v 25 You shall entertain, and give to drink, and have no thanks: 
\q1 And in addition to this you shall hear bitter words. 
\q1
\v 26 Come here, you sojourner, furnish a table, 
\q1 And if you have anything in your hand, feed me with it. 
\q1
\v 27 Go forth, you sojourner, from the face of honor; 
\q1 My brother is come to be my guest; I have need of my house. 
\q1
\v 28 These things are grievous to a man of understanding; 
\q1 The upbraiding of house-room, and the reproaching of the money-lender.

\q1
\v 16 And I waked up last, 
\q1 As one that gleans after the grape gatherers: 
\q1 By the blessing of the Lord I got before them, 
\q1 And filled my winepress as one that gathers grapes. 
\q1
\v 17 Consider that I labored not for myself alone,

\v 18 Hear me, you° great men of the people,

\v 19 To son and wife, to brother and friend,

\q1
\v 20 Whilst you yet live, and breath is in you,

\v 21 For better it is that your children should supplicate you,

\v 22 In all your works keep the upper hand;

\v 23 In the day that you end the days of your life,

\q1
\v 24 Fodder, a stick, and burdens, for an ass; 
\q1 Bread, and discipline, and work, for a servant. 
\q1
\v 25 Set your servant to work, and you shall find rest: 
\q1 Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty. 
\q1
\v 26 Yoke and thong will bow the neck: 
\q1 And for an evil servant there are racks and tortures. 
\q1
\v 27 Send him to labor, that he be not idle; 
\q1 For idleness teaches much mischief. 
\q1
\v 28 Set him to work, as is fit for him; 
\q1 And if he obey not, make his fetters heavy. 
\q1
\v 29 And be not excessive toward any; 
\q1 And without judgement do nothing. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 If you have a servant, let him be as yourself,

\q1
\v 31 If you have a servant, treat him as yourself; 
\q1 \f + \fr 33:31  \ft The Greek text of this line is probably corrupt. \f* For as your own soul will you have need of him:

\q1
\v 1 Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding;

\q1
\v 2 As one that catches at a shadow, and follows after the wind, 
\q1 So is he that sets his mind on dreams. 
\q1
\v 3 The vision of dreams is \add as \add* this thing against that, 
\q1 The likeness of a face near a face. 
\q1
\v 4 Of an unclean thing what shall be cleansed? 
\q1 And of that which is false what shall be true? 
\q1
\v 5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: 
\q1 And the heart fancies, as a woman’s in travail. 
\q1
\v 6 If they be not sent from the Most High in \add your \add* visitation, 
\q1 Give not your heart to them.

\q1
\v 9 A well-instructed man knows many things;

\v 10 He that has no experience knows few things:

\q1
\v 11 In my wandering I have seen many things; 
\q1 And more than my words is my understanding. 
\q1
\v 12 Ofttimes was I in danger even to death; 
\q1 And I was preserved because of these things. 
\q1
\v 13 The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; 
\q1 For their hope is upon him that saves them. 
\q1
\v 14 Whoso fears the Lord shall not be afraid, and shall not play the coward;

\q1
\v 15 Blessed is the soul of him that fears the Lord: 
\q1 To whom does he give heed? and who is his stay? 
\q1
\v 16 The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him, 
\q1 A mighty protection and strong stay, 
\q1 A cover from the hot blast, and a cover from the noonday, 
\q1 A guard from stumbling, and a help from falling. 
\q1
\v 17 He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes: 
\q1 He gives healing, life, and blessing. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 He that sacrifices of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery; 
\q1 And the mockeries of wicked men are not well-pleasing. 
\q1
\v 19 The Most High has no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly; 
\q1 Neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices. 
\q1
\v 20  \add As \add* one that kills the son before his father’s eyes 
\q1 Is he that brings a sacrifice from the goods of the poor. 
\q1
\v 21 The bread of the needy is the life of the poor: 
\q1 He that deprives him thereof is a man of blood. 
\q1
\v 22  \add As \add* one that slays his neighbor is he that takes away his living; 
\q1 And \add as \add* a shedder of blood is he that deprives a hireling of his hire.

\v 23 One building, and another pulling down, 
\q1 What profit have they had but toil? 
\q1
\v 24 One praying, and another cursing, 
\q1 Whose voice will the Lord listen to? 
\q1
\v 25 He that washes himself after \add touching \add* a dead body, and touches it again, 
\q1 What profit has he in his washing? 
\q1
\v 26 Even so a man fasting for his sins,

\q1 Who will listen to his prayer? 
\q1 And what profit has he in his humiliation? 
\b
\c 35  
\q1
\v 1 He that keeps the law multiplies offerings; 
\q1 He that takes heed to the commandments sacrifices a peace offering. 
\q1
\v 2 He that requites a good turn offers fine flour; 
\q1 And he that gives alms sacrifices a thank offering. 
\q1
\v 3 To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord; 
\q1 And to depart from unrighteousness is an atoning sacrifice. 
\q1
\v 4 See that you appear not in the presence of the Lord empty. 
\q1
\v 5 For all these things \add are to be done \add* because of the commandment.

\v 9 In every gift show a cheerful countenance,

\v 11 For the Lord recompenses,

\b
\q1
\v 12 Think not to corrupt with gifts; for he will not receive them: 
\q1 And set not your mind on an unrighteous sacrifice; 
\q1 For the Lord is judge, 
\q1 And with him is no respect of persons. 
\q1
\v 13 He will not accept any person against a poor man; 
\q1 And he will listen to the prayer of him that is wronged. 
\q1
\v 14 He will in no wise despise the supplication of the fatherless; 
\q1 Nor the widow,\f + \fr 35:14  \ft Gr. \fqa if \f* when she pours out her tale.

\q1
\v 17 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds; 
\q1 And till it come near, he will not be comforted; 
\q1 And he will not depart, till the Most High shall visit; 
\q1 And he shall judge\f + \fr 35:17  \ft Some ancient authorities read \fqa for the righteous. \f* righteously, and execute judgement. 
\q1
\v 18 And the Lord will not be slack, neither will he be patient toward them,

\v 21 A woman will receive any man;

\v 22 The beauty of a woman cheers the countenance;

\v 4 There is a companion, which rejoices in the gladness of a friend,

\q1
\v 27 My son, prove your soul in your life,

\v 28 For all things are not profitable for all men,

\v 29 Don’t be insatiable in any luxury,

\v 3 The skill of the physician shall lift up his head;

\q1
\v 4 The Lord created medicines out of the earth;

\q1
\v 5 Was not water made sweet with wood,

\v 9 My son, in your sickness be not negligent;

\v 10 Put away wrong doing, and order your hands aright,

\q1
\v 11 Give a sweet savor, and a memorial of fine flour;

\q1
\v 12 Then give place to the physician, for truly the Lord has created him; 
\q1 And let him not go from you, for you have need of him. 
\q1
\v 13 There is a time when in their very hands is the issue for good. 
\q1
\v 14 For they also shall beseech the Lord,

\q1
\v 15 He that sins before his Maker, 
\q1 Let him fall into the hands of the physician. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 My son, let your tears fall over the dead, 
\q1 And as one that suffers grievously begin lamentation; 
\q1 And wind up his body according to his due, 
\q1 And neglect not his burial. 
\q1
\v 17 Make bitter weeping, and make passionate wailing, 
\q1 And let your mourning be according to his merit, 
\q1 For one day or two, lest you be spoken evil of: 
\q1 And so be comforted for your sorrow. 
\q1
\v 18 For of sorrow comes death, 
\q1 And sorrow of heart will bow down the strength. 
\q1
\v 19 In calamity sorrow also remains: 
\q1 And the poor man’s life is\f + \fr 38:19  \ft Gr. \fqa against the heart. \f* grievous to the heart. 
\q1
\v 20 Don’t give your heart to sorrow. 
\q1 Put it away, remembering the last end. 
\q1
\v 21 Don’t forget it, for there is no returning again: 
\q1 Him you shall not profit, and you will hurt yourself. 
\q1
\v 22 Remember the sentence upon him; for so also shall yours be; 
\q1 Yesterday for me, and today for you. 
\q1
\v 23 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest;

\q1 That drives oxen, and is occupied in their labors, 
\q1 And whose discourse is of the stock of bulls? 
\q1
\v 26 He will set his heart upon turning his furrows; 
\q1 And his wakefulness is to give his heifers their fodder. 
\q1
\v 27 So is every craftsman and workmaster, 
\q1 That passes his time by night as by day; 
\q1 They that cut gravings of signets, 
\q1 And his diligence is to make great variety; 
\q1 He will set his heart to preserve likeness in his portraiture, 
\q1 And will be wakeful to finish his work. 
\q1
\v 28 So is the smith sitting by the anvil,

\q1
\v 10 Nations shall declare his wisdom,

\v 12 Yet more I will utter, which I have thought upon;

\v 13 Listen to me, you° holy children,

\q1
\v 14 And give you° a sweet savor as frankincense,

\q1
\v 15 Magnify his name,

\v 16 All the works of the Lord are exceedingly good, 
\q1 And every command shall be \add accomplished \add* in his season. 
\q1
\v 17 None can say, What is this? wherefore is that? 
\q1 For in his season they shall all be sought out. 
\q1 At his word the waters stood as a heap, 
\q1 And the receptacles of waters at the word of his mouth. 
\q1
\v 18 At his command is all his good pleasure \add done; \add* 
\q1 And there is none that shall hinder his salvation. 
\q1
\v 19 The works of all flesh are before him;

\q1
\v 20 He sees from everlasting to everlasting; 
\q1 And there is nothing wonderful before him. 
\q1
\v 21 None can say, What is this? wherefore is that? 
\q1 For all things are created for their uses. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 His blessing covered the dry land as a river, 
\q1 And saturated it as a flood. 
\q1
\v 23 As he has made the waters salty; 
\q1 So shall the heathen inherit his wrath. 
\q1
\v 24 His ways are plain to the holy; 
\q1 So are they stumbling blocks to the wicked. 
\q1
\v 25 Good things are created from the beginning for the good; 
\q1 So are evil things for sinners. 
\q1
\v 26 The chief of all things necessary for the life of man 
\q1 Are water, and fire, and iron, and salt, 
\q1 And flour of wheat, and honey, and milk, 
\q1 The blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing. 
\q1
\v 27 All these things are for good to the godly; 
\q1 So to the sinners they shall be turned into evil. 
\b
\q1
\v 28 There be winds that are created for vengeance, 
\q1 And in their fury lay on their scourges heavily; 
\q1 In the time of consummation they pour out their strength, 
\q1 And shall appease the wrath of him that made them. 
\q1
\v 29 Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, 
\q1 All these are created for vengeance; 
\q1
\v 30 Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions and adders, 
\q1 And a sword punishing the ungodly to destruction. 
\q1
\v 31 They shall rejoice in his commandment, 
\q1 And shall be made ready upon earth, when need is; 
\q1 And in their seasons they shall not transgress \add his \add* word.

\q1
\v 32 Therefore from the beginning I was resolved,

\v 33 All the works of the Lord are good: 
\q1 And he will supply every need in its season.

\q1 That whatever is might be established in his glory. 
\q1
\v 18 He searches out the deep, and the heart,

\q1
\v 18 The eye will marvel at the beauty of its whiteness, 
\q1 And the heart will be astonished at the raining of it.

\q1 And from the River to the utmost part of the earth. 
\q1
\v 22 In Isaac also did he establish likewise, for Abraham his father’s sake, 
\q1 The blessing of all men, and the covenant: 
\q1
\v 23 And he made it rest upon the head of Jacob; 
\q1 He acknowledged him in his blessings, 
\q1 And gave to him by inheritance, 
\q1 And divided his portions; 
\q1 Among twelve tribes did he part them. 
\b
\c 45  
\q1
\v 1 And he brought out of him a man of mercy, 
\q1 Which found favor in the sight of all flesh; 
\q1 A man beloved of God and men, even Moses, 
\q1 Whose memorial is blessed. 
\q1
\v 2 He made him like to the glory of the saints, 
\q1 And magnified him in the fears of his enemies. 
\q1
\v 3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease; 
\q1 He glorified him in the sight of kings; 
\q1 He gave him commandment for his people, 
\q1 And showed him part of his glory. 
\q1
\v 4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness; 
\q1 He chose him out of all flesh. 
\q1
\v 5 He made him to hear his voice, 
\q1 And led him into the thick darkness, 
\q1 And gave him commandments face to face, 
\q1 Even the law of life and knowledge, 
\q1 That he might teach Jacob the covenant, 
\q1 And Israel his judgments. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 He exalted Aaron, a holy man like to him, 
\q1 Even his brother, of the tribe of Levi. 
\q1
\v 7 He established for him an everlasting covenant, 
\q1 And gave him the priesthood of the people; 
\q1 He\f + \fr 45:7  \ft Gr. \fqa blessed. \f* beautified him with comely ornaments, 
\q1 And girded him about with a robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 8 He clothed him with the perfection of exultation; 
\q1 And strengthened him with apparel of\f + \fr 45:8  \ft Gr. \fqa strength. \f* honor, 
\q1 The linen trousers, the long robe, and the ephod. 
\q1
\v 9 And he compassed him with pomegranates of gold, 
\q1 \add And \add* with many bells round about, 
\q1 To send forth a sound as he went, 
\q1 To make a sound that might be heard in the temple, 
\q1 For a memorial to the children of his people;

\v 10 With a holy garment, with gold and blue and purple, the work of the embroiderer, 
\q1 With an oracle of judgement, \add even \add* with the Urim and Thummim; 
\q1
\v 11 With twisted scarlet, the work of the craftsman; 
\q1 With precious stones graven like a signet, in a setting of gold, the work of the jeweller, 
\q1 For a memorial engraved in writing, after the number of the tribes of Israel;

\q1
\v 13 Before him there never have been any such; 
\q1 No stranger put them on, but his sons only, and his offspring perpertually. 
\q1
\v 14 His sacrifices shall be wholly consumed 
\q1 Every day twice continually. 
\q1
\v 15 Moses\f + \fr 45:15  \ft Gr. \fqa filled his hands. \f* consecrated him, 
\q1 And anointed him with holy oil: 
\q1 It was to him for an everlasting covenant, 
\q1 And to his seed, all the days of heaven, 
\q1 To minister to him, and to execute also the priest’s office, 
\q1 And bless his people in his name. 
\q1
\v 16 He chose him out of all living 
\q1 To offer sacrifice to the Lord, 
\q1 Incense, and a sweet savor, for a memorial, 
\q1 To make reconciliation for your people. 
\q1
\v 17 He gave to him in his commandments, 
\q1 \add Yes, \add* authority in the covenants of judgments, 
\q1 To teach Jacob the testimonies, 
\q1 And to enlighten Israel in his law. 
\q1
\v 18 Strangers gathered themselves together against him, 
\q1 And envied him in the wilderness, 
\q1 \add Even \add* Dathan and Abiram with their company, 
\q1 And the congregation of Korah, with wrath and anger. 
\q1
\v 19 The Lord saw it, and it displeased him; 
\q1 And in the wrath of his anger they were destroyed: 
\q1 He did wonders upon them, 
\q1 To consume them with flaming fire. 
\q1
\v 20 And he added glory to Aaron, 
\q1 And gave him a heritage: 
\q1 He divided to him the first fruits of the increase; 
\q1 \add And \add* first did he prepare bread in abundance: 
\q1
\v 21 For they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord, 
\q1 Which he gave to him and to his seed. 
\q1
\v 22 However in the land of the people he shall have no inheritance, 
\q1 And he has no portion among the people: 
\q1 For he himself is your portion \add and \add* inheritance. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, 
\q1 In that he was zealous in the fear of the Lord, 
\q1 And stood fast in the good forwardness of his soul when the people turned away, 
\q1 And he made reconciliation for Israel. 
\q1
\v 24 Therefore was there a covenant of peace established for him, 
\q1 \add That he should be \add* leader of the\f + \fr 45:24  \ft Or, \fqa sanctuary \f* saints and of his people; 
\q1 That he and his seed 
\q1 Should have the dignity of the priesthood forever. 
\q1
\v 25 Also \add he made \add* a covenant with David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah; 
\q1 The inheritance of the king is his alone from son to son; 
\q1 So the inheritance of Aaron is also to his seed. 
\q1
\v 26  \add God \add* give you wisdom in your heart 
\q1 To judge his people in righteousness, 
\q1 That their good things be not abolished, 
\q1 And \add that \add* their glory \add endure \add* for all their generations.

\q1
\v 1 Joshua the son of\f + \fr 46:1  \ft Gr. \fqa Nave. \f* Nun was valiant in war, 
\q1 And was the successor of Moses in prophecies: 
\q1 Who according to his name was made great

\q1 To take vengeance of the enemies that rose up against them, 
\q1 That he might give Israel their inheritance. 
\q1
\v 2 How was he glorified in the lifting up his hands, 
\q1 And in stretching out his sword against the cities! 
\q1
\v 3 Who before him so stood fast? 
\q1 For the Lord himself brought his enemies to him. 
\q1
\v 4 Did not the sun go back by his hand? 
\q1 And didn’t one day become as two? 
\q1
\v 5 He called upon the Most High \add and \add* Mighty One, 
\q1 When his foes pressed him round about; 
\q1 And the great Lord heard him. 
\q1
\v 6 With hailstones of mighty power 
\q1 He caused war to break violently upon the nation, 
\q1 And\f + \fr 46:6  \ft See Joshua 10:11 \f* in the going down he destroyed those who resisted; 
\q1 That the nations might know his\f + \fr 46:6  \ft Gr. \fqa panoply. \f* armor, 
\q1 How that he fought in the sight of the Lord; 
\q1 For he followed after the Mighty One. 
\q1
\v 7 Also in the time of Moses he did a work of mercy, 
\q1 He and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, 
\q1 In that they withstood the adversary, 
\q1 Hindered the people from sin, 
\q1 And stilled the murmuring of wickedness. 
\q1
\v 8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two alone were preserved 
\q1 To bring them into the heritage, 
\q1 Even into a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\q1
\v 9 Also the Lord gave strength to Caleb, 
\q1 And it remained with him to his old age; 
\q1 So that he entered upon the height of the land, 
\q1 And his seed obtained it for a heritage: 
\q1
\v 10 That all the children of Israel might see 
\q1 That it is good to walk after the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Also the judges, every one by his name, 
\q1 All whose hearts went not a whoring, 
\q1 And who turned not away from the Lord, 
\q1 May their memorial be blessed. 
\q1
\v 12 May their bones flourish again out of their place, 
\q1 And may the name of those who have been honored be renewed upon their children. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, 
\q1 Established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people. 
\q1
\v 14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, 
\q1 And the Lord visited Jacob. 
\q1
\v 15 By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet, 
\q1 And by his words he was known to be faithful in vision. 
\q1
\v 16 Also when his enemies pressed him round about 
\q1 He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One, 
\q1 With the offering of the sucking lamb. 
\q1
\v 17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, 
\q1 And with a mighty sound made his voice to be heard. 
\q1
\v 18 And he utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, 
\q1 And all the princes of the Philistines. 
\q1
\v 19 Also before the time of his\f + \fr 46:19  \ft Gr. \fqa age-long sleep. \f* long sleep 
\q1 He made protestations in the sight of the lord and \add his \add* anointed, 
\q1 I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a sandal: 
\q1 And no man did accuse him. 
\q1
\v 20 And after he fell asleep he prophesied, 
\q1 And showed the king his end, 
\q1 And lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, 
\q1 To blot out the wickedness of the people. 
\b
\c 47  
\q1
\v 1 And after him rose up Nathan 
\q1 To prophesy in the days of David. 
\q1
\v 2 As is the fat when it is separated from the peace offering, 
\q1 So was David \add separated \add* from the children of Israel. 
\q1
\v 3 He played with lions as with kids, 
\q1 And with bears as with lambs of the flock. 
\q1
\v 4 In his youth did he not kill a giant, 
\q1 And take away reproach from the people, 
\q1 When he lifted up his hand with a sling stone, 
\q1 And beat down the boasting of Goliath? 
\q1
\v 5 For he called upon the Most High Lord; 
\q1 And he gave him strength in his right hand, 
\q1 To kill a man mighty in war, 
\q1 To exalt the horn of his people. 
\q1
\v 6 So they glorified him for \add his \add* ten thousands, 
\q1 And praised him for the blessings of the Lord, 
\q1 In that there was given him a diadem of glory. 
\q1
\v 7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, 
\q1 And brought to nothing the Philistines his adversaries, 
\q1 Brake their horn in pieces to this day. 
\q1
\v 8 In every work of his he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High with words of glory; 
\q1 With his whole heart he sang praise, 
\q1 And loved him that made him. 
\q1
\v 9 Also he set singers before the altar, 
\q1 And to make sweet melody by their music.\f + \fr 47:9  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 10 He gave beauty to the feasts, 
\q1 And set in order the seasons to perfection, 
\q1 While they praised his holy name, 
\q1 And the sanctuary sounded from early morning. 
\q1
\v 11 The Lord took away his sins, 
\q1 And exalted his horn forever; 
\q1 And gave him a covenant of kings, 
\q1 And a throne of glory in Israel. 
\q1
\v 12 After him rose up a son, a man of understanding; 
\q1 And for his sake he lived at large. 
\q1
\v 13 Solomon reigned in days of peace; 
\q1 And to him God gave rest round about, 
\q1 That he might set up a house for his name, 
\q1 And prepare a sanctuary forever. 
\q1
\v 14 How wise you were made in your youth, 
\q1 And filled as a river with understanding! 
\q1
\v 15 Your soul covered the earth, 
\q1 And you filled it with\f + \fr 47:15  \ft Gr. \fqa parables of riddles. \f* dark parables. 
\q1
\v 16 Your name reached to the isles afar off; 
\q1 And for your peace you were beloved. 
\q1
\v 17 For your songs and proverbs and parables, 
\q1 And for your interpretations, the countries marveled at you. 
\q1
\v 18 By the name of the Lord God, 
\q1 Which is called the God of Israel, 
\q1 You did gather gold as tin, 
\q1 And did multiply silver as lead. 
\q1
\v 19 You did bow your loins to women, 
\q1 And in your body you were brought into subjection. 
\q1
\v 20 You did blemish your honor, 
\q1 And profane your seed, 
\q1 To bring wrath upon your children; 
\q1 And I was grieved for your folly: 
\q1
\v 21 So that the sovereignty was divided, 
\q1 And out of Ephraim ruled a disobedient kingdom. 
\q1
\v 22 But the Lord will never forsake his mercy; 
\q1 And he will not destroy any of his works, 
\q1 Nor blot out the posterity of his elect; 
\q1 And the seed of him that loved him he will not take away; 
\q1 And he gave a remnant to Jacob, 
\q1 And to David a root out of him. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 And \add so \add* rested Solomon with his fathers; 
\q1 And of his seed he left behind him Rehoboam, 
\q1 \add Even \add* the foolishness of the people, and one that lacked understanding, 
\q1 Who made the people to revolt by his counsel. 
\q1 Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
\q1 Who made Israel to sin, 
\q1 And gave to Ephraim a way of sin. 
\q1
\v 24 And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, 
\q1 To remove them from their land. 
\q1
\v 25 For they sought out all manner of wickedness, 
\q1 Till vengeance should come upon them. 
\b
\c 48  
\q1
\v 1 Also there arose Elijah the prophet as fire, 
\q1 And his word burned like a torch: 
\q1
\v 2 Who brought a famine upon them, 
\q1 And by his zeal made them few in number. 
\q1
\v 3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven: 
\q1 Thrice did he thus bring down fire. 
\q1
\v 4 How you were glorified, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds! 
\q1 And who shall glory like to you? 
\q1
\v 5 Who did raise up a dead man from death, 
\q1 And from\f + \fr 48:5  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the place of the dead, by the word of the Most High: 
\q1
\v 6 Who brought down kings to destruction, 
\q1 And honorable men from their bed: 
\q1
\v 7 Who heard rebuke in Sinai, 
\q1 And judgments of vengeance in Horeb: 
\q1
\v 8 Who anointed kings for retribution, 
\q1 And prophets to succeed after him: 
\q1
\v 9 Who was taken up in a tempest of fire, 
\q1 In a chariot of fiery horses: 
\q1
\v 10 Who was recorded for reproofs in their seasons, 
\q1 To pacify anger, before it brake forth into wrath; 
\q1 To turn the heart of the father to the son, 
\q1 And to restore the tribes of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 11 Blessed are those who saw you, 
\q1 And those who have been beautified with love; 
\q1 For we also shall surely live. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Elijah \add it was, \add* who was wrapped in a tempest: 
\q1 And Elisha was filled with his spirit; 
\q1 And in \add all \add* his days he was not moved by \add the fear of \add* any ruler, 
\q1 And no one brought him into subjection. 
\q1
\v 13  \f + \fr 48:13  \ft Or, \fqa No man’s word overcame him \f* Nothing was too high for him; 
\q1 And when he was laid on sleep his body prophesied. 
\q1
\v 14 As in his life he did wonders, 
\q1 So in death were his works marvelous. 
\q1
\v 15 For all this the people repented not, 
\q1 And they departed not from their sins, 
\q1 Till they were carried away as a plunder from their land, 
\q1 And were scattered through all the earth; 
\q1 And the people was left very few in number, 
\q1 And a ruler \add was left \add* in the house of David. 
\q1
\v 16 Some of them did that which was pleasing \add to God, \add* 
\q1 And some multiplied sins. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Hezekiah fortified his city, 
\q1 And brought in\f + \fr 48:17  \ft Some ancient authorities, apparently by a confusion, read \fqa Gog. \f* water into the midst of them: 
\q1 He digged the sheer rock with iron, 
\q1 And built up wells for waters. 
\q1
\v 18 In his days Sennacherib came up, 
\q1 And sent Rabshakeh, and departed; 
\q1 And he lifted up his hand against Sion, 
\q1 And boasted great things in his arrogance. 
\q1
\v 19 Then were their hearts and their hands shaken, 
\q1 And they were in pain, as women in travail; 
\q1
\v 20 And they called upon the Lord which is merciful, 
\q1 Spreading forth their hands to him: 
\q1 And the Holy One heard them speedily out of Heaven, 
\q1 And delivered them by the hand of Isaiah. 
\q1
\v 21 He struck the camp of the Assyrians, 
\q1 And his angel utterly destroyed them. 
\q1
\v 22 For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing to the Lord, 
\q1 And was strong in the ways of David his father, 
\q1 Which Isaiah the prophet commanded, 
\q1 Who was great and faithful in his vision. 
\q1
\v 23 In his days the sun went backward; 
\q1 And he added life to the king. 
\q1
\v 24 He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last; 
\q1 And he comforted those who mourned in Sion. 
\q1
\v 25 He showed the things that should be to the end of time, 
\q1 And the hidden things or ever they came. 
\b
\c 49  
\q1
\v 1 The memorial of Josiah is like the composition of incense 
\q1 Prepared by the work of the apothecary: 
\q1 It shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, 
\q1 And as music at a banquet of wine. 
\q1
\v 2 He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people, 
\q1 And took away the abominations of iniquity. 
\q1
\v 3 He set his heart right toward the Lord; 
\q1 In the days of wicked men he made godliness to prevail. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Except David and Hezekiah and Josiah, 
\q1 All committed trespass: 
\q1 For they forsook the law of the Most High; 
\q1 The kings of Judah failed. 
\q1
\v 5 For they gave their\f + \fr 49:5  \ft Gr. \fqa horn. \f* power to others, 
\q1 And their glory to a strange nation. 
\q1
\v 6 They set on fire the chosen city of the sanctuary, 
\q1 And made her streets desolate, \add as it was written \add* by the hand of Jeremiah. 
\q1
\v 7 For they mistreated him; 
\q1 And yet he was sanctified in the womb to be a prophet, 
\q1 To root out, and to afflict, and to destroy; 
\q1 \add And \add* in like manner to build and to plant. 
\q1
\v 8  \add It was \add* Ezekiel who saw the vision of glory,

\v 11 How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?

\q1
\v 14 No man was created upon the earth such as was Enoch;

\q1
\v 10 As an olive tree budding forth fruits,

\q1
\v 11 When he took up the robe of glory, 
\q1 And put on the perfection of exultation, 
\q1 In the ascent of the holy altar, 
\q1 He made glorious the precinct of the sanctuary. 
\q1
\v 12 And when he received the portions out of the priests’ hands, 
\q1 Himself also standing by the hearth of the altar, 
\q1 His kindred as a garland round about him, 
\q1 He was as a young cedar in Libanus; 
\q1 And as stems of palm trees compassed they him round about, 
\q1
\v 13 And all the sons of Aaron in their glory, 
\q1 And the Lord’s offering in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel. 
\q1
\v 14 And finishing the service at the altars, 
\q1 That he might adorn the offering of the Most High, the Almighty, 
\q1
\v 15 He stretched out his hand to the\f + \fr 50:15  \ft Gr. \fqa cup of libation. \f* cup,

\p A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. 
\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, O King, 
\q1 And will praise you, O God my Savior: 
\q1 I do give thanks to your name: 
\q1
\v 2 For you were my protector and helper, 
\q1 And did deliver my body out of destruction, 
\q1 And out of the snare of a slanderous tongue, 
\q1 From lips that forge lies, 
\q1 And was my helper before those who stood by; 
\q1
\v 3 And did deliver me, according to the abundance of your mercy, and \add greatness \add* of your name, 
\q1 From the gnashings \add of teeth \add* ready to devour, 
\q1 Out of the hand of such as sought my life, 
\q1 Out of the manifold afflictions which I had; 
\q1
\v 4 From the choking of a fire on every side, 
\q1 And out of the midst of fire which I kindled not; 
\q1
\v 5 Out of the depth of the belly of\f + \fr 51:5  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the grave, 
\q1 And from an unclean tongue, 
\q1 And from lying words, 
\q1
\v 6 The slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king. 
\q1 My soul drew near even to death, 
\q1 And my life was near to\f + \fr 51:6  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades \f* the grave beneath. 
\q1
\v 7 They compassed me on every side, 
\q1 And there was none to help \add me. \add* 
\q1 \add I was \add* looking for the help of men, 
\q1 And it was not. 
\q1
\v 8 And I remembered your mercy, O Lord, 
\q1 And your working which has been from everlasting, 
\q1 How you deliver those who wait for you, 
\q1 And save them out of the hand of the enemies. 
\q1
\v 9 And I lifted up my supplication from the earth, 
\q1 And prayed for deliverance from death. 
\q1
\v 10 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, 
\q1 That he would not forsake me in the days of affliction, 
\q1 In the time when there was no help against the proud. 
\q1
\v 11 I will praise your name continually, 
\q1 And will sing praise with thanksgiving; 
\q1 And my supplication was heard: 
\q1
\v 12 For you saved me from destruction, 
\q1 And delivered me from the evil time: 
\q1 Therefore I will give thanks and praise to you, 
\q1 And bless the name of the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 When I was yet young, 
\q1 Or ever I went abroad, 
\q1 I sought wisdom openly in my prayer. 
\q1
\v 14 Before the temple I asked for her, 
\q1 And I will seek her out even to the end. 
\q1
\v 15 From \add her \add* flower as from the ripening grape my heart delighted in her: 
\q1 My foot trod in uprightness, 
\q1 From my youth I tracked her out. 
\q1
\v 16 I bowed down my ear a little, and received her, 
\q1 And found for myself much instruction. 
\q1
\v 17 I profited in her: 
\q1 To him that gives me wisdom I will give glory. 
\q1
\v 18 For I purposed to practice her, 
\q1 And I was zealous for that which is good; 
\q1 And I shall never be put to shame. 
\q1
\v 19 My soul has wrestled in her, 
\q1 And in my doing I was exact: 
\q1 I spread forth my hands to the heaven above, 
\q1 And bewailed my ignorances of her. 
\q1
\v 20 I set my soul aright to her, 
\q1 And in pureness I found her. 
\q1 I got me a heart \add joined \add* with her from the beginning: 
\q1 Therefore shall I not be forsaken. 
\q1
\v 21 My inward part also was troubled to seek her: 
\q1 Therefore I have gotten a good possession. 
\q1
\v 22 The Lord gave me a tongue for my reward; 
\q1 And I will praise him therewith. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Draw near to me, you° unlearned, 
\q1 And lodge in the house of instruction. 
\q1
\v 24 Say, wherefore are you° lacking in these things, 
\q1 And your souls are very thirsty? 
\q1
\v 25 I opened my mouth, and spoke, 
\q1 Get her for yourselves without money. 
\q1
\v 26 Put your neck under the yoke, 
\q1 And let your soul receive instruction: 
\q1 She is hard at hand to find. 
\q1
\v 27 Behold with your eyes, 
\q1 How that I labored but a little, 
\q1 And found for myself much rest. 
\q1
\v 28 Get you instruction with a great sum of silver, 
\q1 And gain much gold by her. 
\q1
\v 29 May your soul rejoice in his mercy, 
\q1 And may you° not be put to shame in praising him. 
\q1
\v 30 Work your work before the time comes, 
\q1 And in his time he will give you your reward.
