\q1
\v 1 I was small among my brothers, 
\q2 and youngest in my father’s house. 
\q2 I tended my father’s sheep. 
\q1
\v 2 My hands formed a musical instrument, 
\q2 and my fingers tuned a lute. 
\q1
\v 3 Who shall tell my Lord? 
\q2 The Lord himself, he himself hears. 
\q1
\v 4 He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep, 
\q2 and he anointed me with his anointing oil. 
\q1
\v 5 My brothers were handsome and tall; 
\q2 but the Lord didn’t take pleasure in them. 
\q1
\v 6 I went out to meet the Philistine, 
\q2 and he cursed me by his idols. 
\q1
\v 7 But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, 
\q2 and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
