\s God's word becoming human
\p
\v 1 Before the world was created, the one called the Word\f * \fr 1:1 \fq The Word\ft meaning Jesus Christ.\f* was there. The one called the Word was with God. That one called the Word is God.
\v 2 That one called the Word was with God from the beginning.
\v 3 God created everything in the world through that Word. Without him not even one thing was created.
\v 4 In him is life. That life gave light to everyone.
\v 5 Just as the light shines in the darkness, like that he is giving light in people's hearts. But the darkness\f * \fr 1:5 \ft The world which is full of sinful works, having turned from God's way.\f* can never extinguish that light.
\sts I'm not sure what this sts thing is but it shouldn't trip up anything, should it!
\p
\v 6 God sent one man. His name is John the Baptist.\f * \fr 1:6 \ft He is not the apostle John.\f*
\v 7 Having heard his testimony about that light, everyone may believe in the one who is like light.
\v 8 That light giving-one is not John. But he is only a witness to tell about the one who is like light.
\v 9 He who is giving the true light of life to the people of this world, is coming.
\p
\v 10 He who is called the word has come into this world. Through him God caused everything to be created. But those [people] of this world didn't recognize who he really was.
\v 11 He came to his own [people], but those Israel people\f * \fr 1:11 \ft They also call them Jews.\f* did not accept him.
\v 12 But even then whoever believes in him, he gave all of them the authority to become God's children.
\v 13 They were not born of body and blood like children born of husband and wife. But they became his children through God appointing\f * \fr 1:13 \ft They became children through God giving his spirit to them.\f* them.
\p
\v 14-15 That word, having become a man, having come on the earth, lived in our midst. \fig |Cn01656c.jpg|col|||John 1:14 giving baptism to Jesus in John 1:14-15|1:14-15\fig* John the Baptist said about that word, “‘He who will come after me’ I had told, he is this one. Due to him living before me, he is greater than me” he loudly testified. That word showed us God's complete truth and complete grace. Having seen this truth and grace we came to know God's glory. This is the glory which God gave to his only son.
\v 16 Due to his complete grace we are receiving one blessing after another blessing.
\v 17 What those are, the first blessing, so that the people should live according to his desire God had given the law through Moses. But now, the second blessing, through Jesus Christ he gave grace and truth - even better than that law.
\v 18 No one has ever seen God. But the son who is forever with the father,\f * \fr 1:18 \ft Meaning that father God and the son Jesus are one.\f* has revealed about God to us.
\s The witness of John the Baptist
\r (Matthew 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-9,15-17)
\p
\v 19 In order to ask whether this man is the Christ, the Jewish authorities sent priests and Levites\f * \fr 1:19 \ft Levites are from the branch of Levi. These people making sure that everything is in order in God's temple, they were helpers for the priests' work.\f* to John from Jerusalem.
\v 20 So John said, “I am not Christ” he openly testified to them.
\v 21 Then they said, “So, who are you? The prophet Elijah\f * \fr 1:21 \ft He was an ancient a prophet before John the Baptist. The Jews believe that before Christ comes, that prophet would come again.\f*?”. So “I'm not”. “It-seems you are [the] prophet that they said will come in the future?”. But John said, “I'm not”.
\v 22 Then they said, “Who are you really? We have to give an answer to those who sent us. Tell us what we should say about you” they asked John.
\v 23 So John said, “Just as the prophet Isaiah told earlier, I am that voice in the wilderness shouting ‘Prepare a way for God\f * \fr 1:23 \fq God \ft or Lord.\f* to come’” he told them.
\p
\v 24-25 From among the ones who were sent to ask questions, some \w Pharisees\w* said, “You are not Christ, you are not Elijah, also you are not a prophet coming in the future. So with what authority are you giving baptism?” they asked John.
\v 26 So John said, “I am giving water baptism. But the one coming after me is in your midst (or among you). You don't recognize him.
\v 27 The one coming after me is much greater one than I am. I am useless\f * \fr 1:27 \ft He is a great master. I am not even worthy to become his slave.\f* to even untie the straps of his sandals”.
\v 28 This event took place in the town called Bethany on the east side of the Jordan river where John was giving baptism.
\s Revealing that Jesus is God's son
\p
\v 29 The next day John having seen Jesus coming to him said,
\pi “Look! He is God's lamb who is carrying away the sins of the people of the world.
\v 30 Before this, ‘Whoever comes after me, he is greater than me. Because he was alive even before me\f * \fr 1:30 \ft Jesus was alive as a word even before the creation of the world.\f*’ I had told about him.
\v 31 I did not recognize who he really was. But having said that he might reveal himself to the people of Israel, I gave baptism.
\v 32 Then I saw the sky having opened and God's Holy Spirit descending on Jesus like a dove.
\v 33 That God who sent me to give water baptism said, ‘On whom you see the Holy Spirit like a dove having descended and sitting, he is the giver of the \w Holy Spirit\w* baptism\f * \fr 1:33 \ft This means that the sinners hearts are made holy by the spirit's power.\f*’. If [he had] not told like that, I would not have recognized him.
\v 34 Having seen all this said, ‘He is God's son\f * \fr 1:34 \ft He who God appointed.\f*’”
\m like-that John the Baptist testified about Jesus.
\s Jesus' first disciples
\p
\v 35 On the next day at four in the afternoon, John and also two of his \w disciples\w* were standing there.
\v 36 Just then Jesus was passing by from there. Having seen him said, “\wj Look! God's lamb\wj*” John told his disciples.
\v 37 Having heard that, those two disciples followed Jesus.
\v 38 So having seen them following him, Jesus turned around (and said), “What do you want?”. So they said, “Teacher!\f * \fr 1:38 \fq Teacher \ft or ‘Rabbi’.\f* Where do you live?”.
\v 39 So Jesus said, “Come and see”. It was about four in the afternoon then. So having gone to where he was staying, they were there with him on that day.
\v 40 One of those two who had heard John's message and followed Jesus was called Andrew. This man was Simon-Peter's younger brother.
\v 41 That Andrew having met his older brother Simon-Peter and told, “Brother! We have seen the Christ\f * \fr 1:41 \fq Christ \ft In the Hebrew language, they say Messaiah. It's meaning is the king that God appointed and was sending in order to save the people. The Jews were looking for him.\f*”.
\v 42 And he brought him to Jesus. So Jesus having seen him said, “You are John's\f * \fr 1:42 \ft He is not the John the Baptist.\f* son Simon. But from now on may they call you Cephas\f * \fr 1:42 \ft The meaning of both these names is rock.\f*”. They also call him Peter.\x + \xo 1:42 \xt Matthew 16:18\xt*\x*
\s Jesus calling Philip and Nathaniel
\p
\v 43 On the next day Jesus decided to go Galilee area. So having seen Philip on the way he said, “\wj Come with me\wj*” Jesus told.
\v 44 That Philip, Andrew and Peter were all three from the town of Bethsaida.
\v 45 Philip went to find Nathaniel. After meeting him said, “We have met the one written about in Moses' religious law and in the writings of other prophets. He is Jesus, the son of Joseph of Nazareth town” Philip told.
\v 46 Having heard that Nathaniel said, “Uh uh! Can anything good be got in Nazareth?” he asked Philip. So, “Come and see” Philip said.
\v 47 So when Nathaniel was coming to Jesus, having seen him said, “Look! He is a true Israelite. In him there is no deceit” Jesus told about him.
\v 48 So Nathaniel said, “How do you know about me?”. So Jesus said, “Before Philip called you, I saw you while you were below the fig tree”.
\v 49 Then Nathaniel said, “Oh teacher! You are God's son and you are Israelite's king!”.
\v 50 So Jesus said, “Are you putting faith due to the telling that I saw you while you were under the fig tree, or what? You will see even bigger works than these.
\v 51 What those are, the sky having opened, you will see God's angels from heaven descending and ascending on Heaven's Man.\f * \fr 1:51 \ft On God's son who came as a man.\f*\x + \xo 1:51 \xt Genesis 28:12\xt*\x* This is true”.
\c 2
\s Making water into grape juice
\p
\v 1 Two days after this happened, in Galilee area, in the town called Cana, \f * \fr 2:1 \ft In some places it says three days.\f*a wedding happened. Jesus' mother was there.
\v 2 Jesus and his \w disciples\w* were also invited to the wedding. So they went there.
\v 3 At the feast the grape juice finished. So mother said, “The grape juice with them finished” she said to Jesus.
\v 4 So Jesus said, “Why are you telling me mum? The time for revealing who I am is not yet come” he told mother.
\v 5 Then mother with the serving-ones said, “Do as he tells”.
\v 6 In order for Jews to do deed of cleansing, there were six large-pots carved from rock. Each large-pot used to hold seven-or-eight water-carriers of water.
\v 7 Jesus said, “Fill those large-pots with water” he told the serving-ones. So they filled those large-pots completely.
\v 8 Then Jesus said, “Now you all! Draw some of it and take it to the master of the feast”, he told like that. So they took [it].
\v 9-10 That master of the feast tasted the grape juice that was from water. \fig |CN01667C.jpg|col|||Making water into grape juice|2:9-10\fig* Those servants knew where that juice came from and how it was prepared. But the master of the feast did not know. So that man having called the bridegroom said, “Everyone else having poured good juice\f * \fr 2:9-10 \ft The Jews having extracted grape juice, and having kept if for many days, cause it to ferment. After it has changed like wine they drink it.\f* first, after the crowd became drunk, [they] pour untasty grape juice. But you have caused the best juice to be poured even at the end”.
\v 11 Like this in Galilee area's village called Cana having done this glorious sign Jesus showed his power. Therefore his disciples put faith on him.
\p
\v 12 After that Jesus, his mother, brothers and disciples gathered and went to the town called Capernaum. And for some days they were there.
\s Jesus going to the temple
\r (Matthew 21:12-13; Mark 11:15-17; Luke 19:45-46)
\p
\v 13-14 The Jew's Passover festival came near. So Jesus went to Jerusalem. After reaching there, Jesus went to God's temple. In that \w temple's|Temple\w* courtyard there were business people selling bulls, sheep and doves for giving sacrifices and also money-exchangers.
\v 15 Having seen that, Jesus having made a like a whip with ropes, he chased the sheep-and-bulls and everyone from the temple. Having scattered the money of those money-exchangers, he turned their tables upside-down.
\v 16 He said to those selling doves, “Don't make my father's house like a market. Take all these things out from here”.
\p
\v 17 Having seen that, “Due to desiring that people give much respect to your house, others are strongly opposing me”\x + \xo 2:17 \xt Psalms 69:9\xt*\x* the disciples remembered that it is written in the scripture.
\p
\v 18 But the Jewish authorities having come to Jesus said, “If God has given you authority to do like this, [then] show us a sign?”.
\v 19 So Jesus said, “Break down this temple. I will come back and build it in three days”.
\p
\v 20 Having heard that the Jews having become amazed said, “It took forty six years to build this temple. You can build it in three days?” they said to Jesus.
\v 21 But Jesus told this message about the temple of his own body.
\v 22 The disciples, after Jesus' death and \w resurrection|Raising back to life\w*, having remembered this, put their faith on the word that is written in \w scripture\w* and on what Jesus said.
\s Jesus knows what is in a man's heart
\p
\v 23 In Jerusalem during the days of the Passover festival, having seen the miraculous deeds that Jesus did, many people put faith in him.
\v 24-25 But Jesus did not trust them. Due to Jesus knowing everyone's hearts, no one else needs to testify to Jesus about others.
\c 3
\s You will have to take birth once again
\p
\v 1 There was an important Jewish authority of the \w Pharisees\w* called Nicodemus.
\v 2 One night time he went to Jesus (and said), “Teacher, we know that ‘you are one who has come from God’. Because without God's help, no one can do the miracles that you do”.
\v 3 Then Jesus said, “A man cannot partake in\f * \fr 3:3 \ft In the Greek language it has “Cannot see the kingdom of God”.\f* the kingdom of God without taking new birth. This matter is true” he told Nicodemus.
\v 4 Then Nicodemus said, “How can an old man take birth again? Is he able to enter into his mother's womb once more to take birth, or what?” he asked Jesus.
\v 5 So Jesus said, “A man cannot enter the kingdom of God without the birth of water and of the spirit.\x + \xo 3:5 \xt Ezekiel 36:25-28\xt*\x* This matter is true”.
\v 6 “Parents are able to give physical birth. But God's spirit is able to give birth to spirit.
\v 7 Therefore you do not be amazed if [I] say ‘[You] must take a new birth’.
\v 8 The wind blows from whichever side it desires. You hear the noise of that wind but where that wind comes from, and where it goes you do not know. It is also the same way being born with God's spirit” Jesus told.
\p
\v 9 So Nicodemus said, “How can this happen?” he asked Jesus.
\v 10 Then Jesus said, “You are an important teacher of the Israelite people. And you don't know about this?”.
\v 11 “We tell about what we know and what we have seen. This matter is true. But you do not believe our testimony.
\v 12 You do not put faith when I tell you a message about this world. So how will you put faith if I tell a message about heaven?”.
\v 13 “Except for me, Heaven's Man, who came down from heaven, no one else has gone to heaven above.
\v 14 Just as Moses in the wilderness made a bronze snake and dangled it on a tall stick,\x + \xo 3:14 \xt Numbers 21:9\xt*\x* like that I who am Heaven's Man must also be hung up on the log.
\v 15 Doing like that those who put their faith in me will get eternal life.
\p
\v 16 “Due to God loving the people of the world very much he sent his only son to the earth. He did like this so that everyone putting faith on his son, would get eternal life without being destroyed.
\v 17 God did not send his son in order to punish the people of the world but he sent [him] in order to save [them].
\p
\v 18 “Whoever believes in him will not be judged. But he who does not believe, due to him not believing in God's only son, has already been judged.
\v 19 Because he brought light for all the world's people. But people while doing their bad works, liked being in darkness. This is the reason for that judgement.
\v 20 Every man who does bad works does not like the light. In order to keep his bad works hidden, he will not come to the light.
\v 21 But he who follows truth, will come to the light in order to show that his works are happening through God”.
\s John telling witness about Jesus
\p
\v 22 After that, Jesus and his \w disciples\w* having gone to the area of Judea, while causing [them] to give baptism to people, he was there for some days.
\v 23 Due to there being much water nearby Salim at a place called Aenon, John was giving baptism there.
\v 24 So people having gone were taking baptism. This event happened before John had fallen into jail.
\v 25 One day, an argument about becoming ritually clean started between a Jew and John's disciples.
\v 26 So the disciples having come to John said, “Teacher! The one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, and about whom you gave witness, he is now giving baptism. Everyone is going to him”.
\v 27 So John said “Unless God gives it from heaven no one can take anything.
\v 28 You all are witness that ‘I am not the Christ. But I am the messenger sent before him’.
\v 29 For example, say that the groom is the important one at the marriage. He is the bride's master. His [the groom's] friend will be very happy to stand near to that groom and to do according to what he tells. In the same way I am very happy. My happiness is complete.
\v 30 Because I should become of lower status and higher status should come to Jesus.
\p
\v 31 “He who came from heaven is above everyone else. We are of the earth and we speak about matters that will happen on the earth. Whoever has come from heaven, is above everyone else.
\v 32 He will testify about what he has seen and heard there. But no one will accept his testimony.
\v 33-35 Due to God loving his son, he handed over all his authority to him. Due to him being completely filled with his given spirit, he will only speak God's words. Anyone who accepts his testimony shows that the words Jesus told about God are true.
\v 36 Anyone who has faith in God's son, will get eternal life. Anyone who does not have faith in him, does not get eternal life. But God's anger will be on him” John the baptist told.

\s Jesus talking to a woman at the well
\p
\v 1 The \w Pharisees\w* heard that Jesus was making more \w disciples\w* and giving them baptism than John.
\v 2 (In reality Jesus himself did not give baptism. But his disciples were giving.)
\v 3 After hearing this message, having left Judea, Jesus left to go to the area of Galilee.
\p
\v 4 But now, he had to cross the area of Samaria.
\v 5 Like that while crossing the area of Samaria, he reached a town called Sychar, near to the land\x + \xo 4:5 \xt Genesis 33:19; Joshua 24:32\xt*\x* that Jacob gave his son Joseph.
\v 6 There was a well that Jacob had caused to be dug. Due to having come walking a long distance, Jesus, having become tired, was sitting beside that well at midday.
\v 7-8 At that time, his disciples went into the town in order to buy food. Just then a Samaritan woman came in order to take water from the well. \fig |LB00302C.jpg|col|||Jesus talking with samaritan lady|4:7-8\fig* So Jesus said, “Sister, give me water to drink” he asked that woman.
\p
\v 9 The Jews and the Samaritans used to live separately. Therefore having heard Jesus' words that woman having become amazed said, “Ya-yah! You are a Jew. I am a Samaritan. How do you ask ‘Give (me) water to drink’?” she said.
\v 10 Having heard that, Jesus said, “You do not know about the one who is asking ‘Give water to drink’, or about God's gift. If you knew these, you would instead ask me for that and I would give you living water” he told her.
\v 11 Then the woman said, “Sir! You don't have either a rope or a bucket with you in order to draw water. This well is very deep. Where will you get that living water?
\v 12 Our forefather Jacob gave this well to us. He himself, and his sons, and their cattle also drank from this well. Are you greater than Jacob [or what]?” she asked Jesus.
\v 13 So Jesus said, “Everyone who drinks this water will thirst again.
\v 14 But the drinker of the water I am giving will never thirst (again). The water I am giving to live forever, will be like a spring of water always flowing inside him,”.
\p
\v 15 So that woman said, “Sir! In order to never be thirsty and to not come to draw water, give me that water” she asked Jesus.
\v 16 Then Jesus said, “Having gone, and having called your husband, bring [him]”.
\v 17 So the woman said, “I don't have a husband” she said. Having heard that, “Yes, that's true,
\v 18 you had five husbands earlier. Now he who is with you is not your husband. Sister, what you told is true” he said to that woman.
\p
\v 19 Then the woman said, “Sir! I am realising that you are a prophet.
\v 20 So tell me this thing: We worship on this Gerazim hill. Here itself our ancestors also worshipped. But why do you Jews tell that only Jerusalem is the true worship doing place?” she talked with Jesus.
\v 21-23 So Jesus said, “Sister! You Samaritans don't know whom you worship. But we know who we worship. Because from among our Jewish people the work of salvation will come. At that time you all will not worship father God either on this hill or in Jerusalem. But the true worshipers should worship him truly in their spirit. Now that time has come. Believe on this word I have told you. Father God is looking for people who would worship him like that.
\v 24 Due to God being a spirit, his worshippers should worship him truly in their spirit” Jesus told the woman.
\v 25 Then the woman said to Jesus, “I know that Christ\f * \fr 4:25 \fq Christ \ft In the Hebrew language, they say Messaiah. It's meaning is the king that God appointed and was sending in order to save the people. The Jews were looking for him.\f* will come. It seems that after he comes he will tell everyone everything openly” she told Jesus.
\v 26 So, “I am that man,” Jesus told the woman.
\p
\v 27 Just then Jesus' disciples came there. Having seen him speaking to the woman, they were very surprised. But none of them asked either ‘What do you want?’ like-that to the woman, or ‘Why did you speak to that woman?’ like-that to Jesus.
\p
\v 28 Having left her clay pot there, that woman went off to the town.
\v 29 And she said to people, “He told me about everything I have done until now. Could that man perhaps be the Christ? You all come and see”.
\v 30 So having come out from that town, they were coming to the place where Jesus was.
\p
\v 31 At that time, his disciples said, “Respected teacher! Eat something” they pleaded to Jesus.
\v 32 But Jesus said, “I have food to eat that you don't know [about]”.
\v 33 So the disciples said, “Could someone have brought food for the teacher?” they said to each other.
\v 34 Then Jesus said, “My food is to follow the desire of God who sent me and to complete his work.
\v 35 For example you say, ‘After sowing the seeds, in four months the harvest will come’. But look towards the fields. That harvest is now ready to cut\f * \fr 4:35 \ft The harvest is bringing people to God's presence. What it means is that many Samaritan people were coming to Jesus. He said [my] food is to tell them about God's way.\f*” I am telling you.
\v 36 “The reapers are getting the daily wage now. The crop that he reapers get is bringing people into eternal life. Through this both the sowers and the reapers will be able to be happy together.
\v 37 ‘One man is a sower and another man is a reaper’ is a saying that is true.
\v 38 I sent you to reap that crop which you did not take the trouble of planting. Other people took the trouble to sow the seed. You are all taking the fruit of their trouble”.
\p
\v 39 “He told me about all I have done before I told him” that woman said. So, on hearing that testimony many people of that Samaritan town believed in Jesus.
\v 40 The Samaritans having come to him said, “[Respected] teacher! Having come to us you must stay” the pleaded. So Jesus was with them for two days.
\v 41 Having directly heard the words Jesus told, many more became believers.
\v 42 (They said), “We believed, not just according to what you said, but having heard his message directly, having come to know that he is the Christ, the saviour of the world” having said they told the woman.
\s Jesus heals an official's son
\r (Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10)
\p
\v 43 Two days later Jesus left to go to Galilee area.
\v 44 (Jesus had earlier said that, ‘A prophet does not get respect in his home area.’)
\v 45 But even then, after he in Galilee area, the people from there, having given him respect, welcomed him. Because, while the Passover festival was going on, they had gone to Jerusalem and had seen Jesus' miraculous works.
\v 46 While going-and-going like that, he arrived at Cana town in Galilee, where previously he had caused water to be changed into grape juice. There was a king's officer in the town called Capernaum. His son was sick and about to die.
\v 47 So that officer, having heard that Jesus had come from Judea to the area of Galilee, went to Jesus. And said, “My son is sick and about to die. You must come and heal him” he pleaded.
\v 48 So Jesus said, “Will you not believe in me without wonders and miraculous works?”.
\v 49 But even then that officer said, “Lord! Come before my son's life goes”.
\v 50 Then, “Go home. Your son will live” Jesus told. So the officer put his trust in Jesus word and left.
\v 51 While he was on the way like that, his servants having come before [him] said, “Your son is healed”.
\v 52 So the officer asked, “At what time did he become healed?” he asked the servants. Then they said, “Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock he became well”.
\v 53 Having realized it was at that time Jesus had said, ‘Your son will live’, the officer and his household members put their faith in Jesus.
\v 54 Having come from Judea area to Galilee, this was the second glorious sign that Jesus did.
\c 5
\s Healing the paralyzed man
\p
\v 1 After that, due to a Jewish festival approaching, Jesus went up to Jerusalem city.
\v 2 In Jerusalem, near a place called the Sheep's Gate, there was a [man-made] pool called Bethesda in the Hebrew language. At that pool there were five porches.
\v 3-4 \f * \fr 5:3-4 \ft These words are not in some ancient Greek scriptures.\f*[At that pool sometimes God's angel having descended used to stir up the water. Then whoever was first to descend [into the water] used to be healed of whatever disease.] All kinds of sick people - the blind, the handicapped people, and paralyzed - used to stay at those porches.
\v 5 Among them, there was a man who had been sick for thirty eight years.
\v 6 Having seen the man, Jesus, having known he was suffering for many years with sickness said, “Do you want to become well?” he asked him.
\v 7 So that man said, “Lord! There is nobody to lower me into that pool while the water is shaking. Therefore, while I am coming to descend someone else will descend before me”.
\v 8 Then Jesus said, “Get up! Take your sleeping-mat and go home” he said.
\v 9 As soon as said like that, having become well, having taken his sleeping-mat, he went walking.
\p This incident happened on the Jew's rest day.
\v 10 So the Jews said, “Due to today being the rest day, carrying your sleeping-mat is against the religious law” they said to the healed man.
\v 11 But he said, “The one who healed me said ‘Take your sleeping-mat and go’” he told them.
\v 12 So they asked, “Who told you to ‘Take your sleeping-mat and go?’”.
\v 13 But he could not tell. Because there was a big crowd of people, Jesus mixed into the crowd and went off.
\v 14 After that Jesus, having seen him at the \w temple\w* courtyard, said, “Look, listen! You have been healed. In order to avoid more sorrow, don't do sinful deeds”.
\v 15 Then, having gone to the Jewish authorities, said, “It was Jesus who healed me”.
\p
\v 16 As a result of Jesus doing works like these on the rest day, those Jewish authorities started persecuting Jesus.
\v 17 But Jesus said, “Due to my father always working, I am also working”.
\v 18 So, for this reason the Jewish authorities said, “Not only is he sliding away from our law of a rest day, (but) having told that God is his father, he is making himself as great as God” due to these two reasons they decided that they should kill Jesus.
\s God's authority is with Jesus
\p
\v 19 So Jesus explained to them like this: “This is true. God's son cannot do anything by himself. The son will only do that which he has seen the father do. However father God does, in that way the son will do.
\v 20 Due to the father loving the son, he is showing the son all his work. Having seen the great works my father causes the son to do in the future, you will be very amazed.
\v 21 How the father causes the dead to rise [to life], like that the son himself will also cause-to-live those whom he chooses.
\v 22 The father does not judge anyone. But he gave his son the complete authority to judge.
\v 23 God gave that authority into his son's hand so that everyone should also respect the son just as they respect him. If anyone does not respect the son he sent, they will also not be counted as someone giving respect to the father.
\v 24 Having heard my message and having put faith in the one who sent me, he will get eternal life. That kind of man will escape the coming punishment for sins. Having escaped death, he has got eternal life.
\p
\v 25 “This is true. The time is coming (when) the dead ones will hear the word of God's son. Now that (time) has come. Those who hear and follow that word will live forever.
\v 26 Just as God is the owner of life, like that he gave his son the authority for giving eternal life.
\v 27 Due to him being Heaven's Man, the father gave him the authority to judge people.
\v 28 You don't be amazed! A time is coming. At that time, having heard the word of God's son, all the dead ones in their graves, having risen [to life] they will come out.
\v 29 The son, having judged those having \w risen|Raising back to life\w* and come out, from among them he will give eternal life to righteous ones and he will punish sinners.
\v 30 I do not judge according to my wish but according the wish of the one who sent me. By myself I cannot do anything. I will judge people in the way my father tells me to. Whatever I judge is just.
\s Testimonies about Jesus
\p
\v 31 “If I testify about myself, they will not accept my testimony as true.
\v 32 Someone is there to testify about me. I know that the testimony he is telling is true.
\p
\v 33 “You sent some people to John. His testimony is true.
\v 34-35 John was giving light like a burning lamp. You all were very happy for a short time with his light. So that you may be saved, I am telling these words.
\p “But I do not need mankind's testimony.
\v 36 Because there is a testimony greater than John's with me. That is the miraculous works that I did. God handed over these works to me to do. These prove that the father sent me.
\v 37 And that father is testifying about me. But you all never listened to his word and never saw his shape.
\v 38 Due to you not putting your faith in the sent one, his teaching will not be in your hearts.
\v 39 Thinking that you will find out about eternal life, you search the \w scriptures|Scripture\w* well. But those words are telling witness about me.
\v 40 But even then you refuse to come to me for that eternal life.
\p
\v 41 “I don't want honour of men.
\v 42 Because I know that you do not love God.
\v 43 I have come in the name of my father. You did not accept me. But if someone else comes in his own name, you accept him with joy.
\v 44 You like others giving you honour, but you don't try to get the honour that the only God gives. So, how will you be able to put your faith in me?
\v 45 Don't think that I will accuse you in [the presence of] the father. But you put your hope on the prophet Moses who wrote the religious law. That Moses will accuse you.
\v 46 Due to what Moses wrote about me, if you had faith in him, you would have also have had faith in me.
\v 47 But if you do not believe the words of the law that Moses wrote, how can you believe my message?” Jesus told the Jewish authorities.
\c 6
\s Jesus giving a feast to a crowd of five thousand people
\r (Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17)
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus went with his disciples toward the other side of the sea of Galilee.\f * \fr 6:1 \ft They also call it the Sea of Tiberias.\f*
\v 2 Having seen Jesus doing miracles of healing sick people, a big crowd was following him.
\v 3 So, having climbed a hill Jesus sat (down) with his \w disciples\w*.
\v 4 In those days the Jewish Passover festival was approaching.
\v 5 At that time, having looked up and around. Jesus saw a crowd of many people coming to him. “From where should we buy and bring food for all these people to eat?” Jesus asked Philip.
\v 6 He himself knew what he was going to do. But to know what was in Philip's mind, Jesus asked like that.
\v 7 So Philip said, “Even if you bought and brought food with 200 silver coins,\f * \fr 6:7 \ft Two hundred silver coins were worth more than eight months' daily wages. They call these Denarius.\f* it would be insufficient for each man to have even a little” he gave an answer.
\v 8-9 Then from among his disciples, Simon-Peter's younger brother, Andrew, said “Here, with one boy are five (loaves of) bread and two small fish. \fig |CN01700C.jpg|span|||Jesus speaking to the crowd|6:8-9\fig* But these will not be enough for this many people” he told Jesus.
\v 10 So, as there was grass for sitting there, Jesus said, “You make the people sit on it”. So, without counting the children and women, approximately five thousand (5,000) males sat [to eat].
\v 11 Then Jesus, having held the breads, having said thanks to God, he gave to be distributed. Like that he gave the fish. They ate as much as they could eat.
\v 12 After the people had fully eaten, he said “To prevent even a little being wasted, gather all the remaining pieces” he told the disciples.
\v 13 So the disciples filled twelve large baskets, by gathering the leftover pieces from the five breads that were eaten.
\v 14 Having seen that glorious sign, the people became amazed. And they said, “Truly he is the prophet\x + \xo 6:14 \xt Deuteronomy 18:15,18\xt*\x* who has to come into this world”.
\v 15 So Jesus, having known the people would forcefully (try) to make him king, he went alone toward the a hill.
\s Jesus walking on water of the sea
\r (Matthew 14:22-27; Mark 6:45-52)
\p
\v 16-17 While the sun was setting that day, Jesus' disciples having gone near the shore of the Sea of Galilee, were waiting for Jesus. But even though it was becoming dark, Jesus had not yet returned. So the disciples left in a boat to go to Capernaum on the other side of the sea.
\v 18 Just at that time a big wind-storm rose up, increasing the sea's waves.
\v 19 After making the boat go about three or four 'kosk' (1 kosk=one and a half kilometres), having seen Jesus coming towards their boat walking on the water, they were very afraid.
\v 20 But Jesus said, “Don't fear! It is me” he told them.
\v 21 Then they joyfully caused him to sit in that boat. Then immediately that boat arrived at the palce where they were going.
\p
\v 22-23 On the next day some boats arrived from Tiberias city at the place where the Lord had prayed and given the feast. So, the people who stayed on the other side of the sea knew that the disciples went by only one boat. But Jesus had not gone along with them.
\v 24 The crowd searched for Jesus and his disciples but they did not find any one. So having sat in those boats, they went searching for Jesus to Capernaum.
\p
\v 25 After hey saw Jesus on the other shore of the sea, they said, “(Respected) teacher! When did you come here?”.
\s Jesus is the food that gives strength to life
\p
\v 26-27 So Jesus said, “You are searching for me, not because of understanding the miraculous deeds but because [you] fully ate food. Don't be eager for food that becomes rotten. But be eager for the food which keeps your life forever given by Heaven's Man. God has put his seal of authority on me to give like that. This is true”.
\v 28 Then they said, “What does God want us to do?”.
\v 29 So Jesus said, “God asks that you put your faith on whomever he has sent,” having said he told.
\v 30-31 Having heard that they said, “Our ancestors, while coming from Egypt, ate food called manna in the wilderness. According to what is written in scripture, he gave them that food to eat from heaven.\x + \xo 6:30-31 \xt Psalms 78:24\xt*\x* So, for us now to put faith on you, what kind of glorious sign will you show?”.
\v 32 Then Jesus, said, “The prophet Moses did not give that food from heaven, but my father from heaven gave (it). Now my father is giving that true food from heaven.
\v 33 Whatever the father has sent from heaven, it will give life to the people of the world. This is the true food God sent”.
\v 34 So they said, “Lord! Always give us that food”.
\v 35 Then Jesus said, “I am the life-giving food. Those who trust in me and follow my way, their hearts will never be hungry and they will never thirst.
\v 36 But as I said before, even after seeing me you did not put your faith in me.
\v 37 But even then, whoever the father sends to me, they will come to me. I will not shove away anyone who comes to me.
\v 38 Because having descended from heaven, I did not come in order to do my will. But I have come to do the will of the one who sent me.
\v 39 What that means is that the desire of the one who sent me is that I should protect so that not even one man is lost from among those who are sent to me. On that judgement doing day, I must raise them [to life].
\v 40 Because the father's desire is that he who puts faith and looks towards his son should get eternal life. On the judgement doing day I will raise [to life] the faith putting one like that” he told them.
\v 41-42 Then those Jewish people, said, “‘Having descended I am the food that came from heaven,’ he says. Isn't this Jesus just Joseph's son! We know his parents. Why does he say ‘I have descended from heaven’?” they murmured.
\v 43 So Jesus said, “You yourselves don't murmur” he said to them.
\v 44 “In whoever's heart the father who sent me causes the desire, they come to me. Others won't come. I will raise to life on that judgement doing day whoever comes to me”.
\v 45 “‘God will teach them’\x + \xo 6:45 \xt Isaiah 54:13\xt*\x* like-that the prophets wrote. Whoever has learned and followed according to those words, only they come to me.
\v 46 I am telling that there is no one who has seen the father. Only I have seen the father and come.
\v 47 It is true that whoever who puts his faith in me, will get eternal life.
\v 48 I am the food of life.
\v 49 Your ancestors ate that food called manna in the wilderness but even then they died.
\v 50 But anyone who eats this food that comes down from heaven will never die.
\v 51 I am the life-giving food that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this food will live forever. That food is my body. I will sacrifice that body in order to give eternal life to the world's people”.
\v 52 Having heard this the Jews said, “How is he able to give us his own body to eat?” they discussed angrily among themselves.
\v 53 So Jesus, said, “If you don't eat the body of Heaven's Man, or drink his blood, you cannot get this eternal life. This is true.
\v 54 But anyone who eats my body and drinks my blood, he will live forever. Even if he dies, I will raise him [to life] on the judgement doing day.
\v 55 Because my body is the true food and my blood is the true drink.
\v 56 Anyone who eats my body and drinks my blood, we will be together - I will be in him and he will be in me.
\v 57 Due to the living father sending me, I am alive. Like that anyone who eats my body will remain alive through me.
\v 58 I am the true food that came from heaven. [Our] ancestors ate food called manna and died. But I am telling you that those who eat this food will live forever”.
\v 59 Jesus told these things while teaching in the synagogue\f * \fr 6:59 \fq Synagogue \ft means the house where Jews gather together.\f* at Capernaum.
\s Teaching about eternal life
\p
\v 60 Heard these words those believers said, “This teaching is very difficult. Who will accept this teaching?” they grumbled.
\v 61-62 So having known that Jesus said, “If you become angry having heard this message, how will you be if you see Heaven's Man, being taken up to the place he came from?” he said to the believers.
\v 63 “The body cannot give life. Only through God's spirit are you alive. The things I say are the words of the life-giving spirit.
\v 64 But among you there are some people who don't have faith” he told them. Because from the beginning Jesus knew who will not believe and who will deceive him.
\v 65 And again Jesus said, “No one is able to come to me unless my father sends you. For that reason I told you all these words”.
\v 66 From then on many of Jesus' followers went back and they never again followed his way.
\v 67 Therefore, Jesus having turned towards his twelve disciples said, “Are you also saying let's go?”.
\v 68 Then Simon-Peter said, “Lord, with whom would we go? You are the only one telling the words that give eternal life.
\v 69 Having put faith we came to know that ‘You are the \w holy\w* one that God sent’”.
\v 70 So Jesus said, “Didn't I choose you twelve people? But one among you has the mind of Satan”.
\v 71 Simon son Judas of Iscariot village, even though he was one of the twelve disciples, became a betrayer. For that reason he told this message about him.
\c 7
\s Jesus and his brothers
\p
\v 1 After this due to the Jewish authorities wanting to kill Jesus, he did not go to the area of Judea. He was only going around in the area of Galilee.
\v 2 But at that time the Jewish festival of tents\x + \xo 7:2 \xq festival of tents \xt Leviticus 23:39-43\xt*\x* was approaching.
\v 3 So Jesus' brothers said, “You go to Judea from here. Then your devotees from there will see your miracles.
\v 4 If [you stay] here you will not get honour. If you really do these miracles, show the world's people,” they told their older brother.
\v 5 [This] means, even his brothers did not put their faith in Jesus.
\p
\v 6 So Jesus, said to them, “The time has not yet come to make myself known. But you can go there whenever [you want].
\v 7 The people of this world cannot stay without liking you. But due to me telling their works are wicked, those people hate me.
\v 8 You go for the festival. Because my time is yet to be fulfilled, I will not go with you now” he told them.
\v 9 Having told like this, Jesus stayed in Galilee.
\p
\v 10 But after his brothers went for the festival, Jesus also went there, not openly but secretly.
\v 11 While the festival was happening the Jewish authorities (saying), “Where is he?” they searched for him.
\v 12 So some people from that crowd said “Jesus is a good man” said and some other people “No no, he is a deceiver of people” they quietly discussed.
\v 13 But with fear of the Jewish authorities, no one spoke openly about Jesus.
\s Jesus teaching in the temple during the Festival of Tents
\p
\v 14 After half of the days of that festival were over, Jesus having gone to the \w temple\w*, began to teach.
\v 15 Having heard that, they said, “This man really did not take training from any teacher. But from where did he get this much knowledge?” the Jews were amazed.
\v 16 So Jesus said, “I am not speaking my (own) words. But these [words] are God's who sent me.
\v 17 If anyone from among you wants to live according to God's desire, he will know if these words are coming from God or from me.
\v 18 Whoever teaches his own words, he honours himself. But whoever wishes to honour the one who sent him, he is a trustworthy person. There is nothing wrong in him.
\v 19 The prophet Moses gave you the religious law. Even then not even one from among you is following them. Instead of this you are trying to kill me,” Jesus said.
\v 20 Having heard that the people who had come from different villages said, “Ehe! Who (are) are looking to kill you? Are possessed by an \w evil-spirit\w*, or what?”.
\v 21 So Jesus said, “You all were very amazed having seen the miracle I did on the rest day.
\v 22 It is in Moses' law that you should \w circumcise|Circumcision\w*\f * \fr 7:22 \ft There is a command in Moses' law that on the 8th day [after] a baby-boy is born, the circumcision deed must be done.\f* your sons. This custom was not started by Moses. But it came from (our) ancestors. But even then you are also doing this deed on the rest day.
\v 23 Why are you angry with me? You think that if you circumcise a boy on the rest day it is not breaking Moses' law. But if I heal a man on that day you call me a law-breaker.
\v 24 Don't judge by outer appearance. But having thought, you [should] judge justly” Jesus told.
\s Is Jesus the Christ?
\p
\v 25 Then some people from Jerusalem said, “Isn't this man the one that those authorities are searching for in order to kill?” they started saying like that.
\v 26 “Look! He is openly speaking. But even then no one is saying anything. Perhaps the authorities know that he is the true Christ?
\v 27 But when Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from. We know where he is from” they spoke.
\v 28 Then while Jesus was teaching in the temple he said “You think that you know whose I am and where I have come from. But I did not come here by myself. The one who sent me is the righteous one. You don't know who he is.
\v 29 But I know him. Due to his command [for me] to go, I have come here,” he told loudly.
\v 30 At that time the authorities tried to catch him. But no one could lay a hand on him. Because his time was yet to be fulfilled.
\v 31 But even then (the people said), “When Christ comes, will he do even more miracles than him?” having said, many people put their faith in him.
\v 32 The \w Pharisees\w*\f * \fr 7:32 \fq Pharisees \ft The Pharisees were important people in the Jewish religion. They said everyone should follow God's customs. But they themselves thought up the customs and rules having prepared them very [carefully] these also should be followed like that they said.\f* heard these quietly whispered words and these Pharisees and chief priests having gathered together, sent the temple guards to catch Jesus.
\v 33 Then Jesus said, “For a little while, I will be with you. After that time is fulfilled, I will return to the one who sent me.
\v 34 You may search for me, but you will not find me. Where I have gone you cannot come”.
\v 35 The Jewish authorities said to themselves, “Where would he be going if we can't find him even if we look for him? Perhaps, having gone to the Jewish people who have spread out to other countries, will he tell God's teaching to those\f * \fr 7:35 \ft Here it is “Greeks”. But according to the Jews “Greeks” means all the other tribes.\f* who don't know about God?
\v 36 Saying ‘You may search for me but you will not find me. Where I am going you cannot come’ what does it mean?” they spoke.
\s Jesus promising life sustaining water
\p
\v 37 The final day of that festival is very important. So on that day Jesus, having stood up, said, “He who is thirsty, having come to me should drink water.
\v 38 In whoever puts their faith in me, as it is said in the \w scripture\w*, ‘Life sustaining water will be flowing from his inside’ just”.
\v 39 Jesus told that matter about life sustaining water flowing out, about those who believed on him getting God's spirit. Jesus had not yet resurrected. Therefore the spirit had not yet come to them.
\v 40 Some people listening to these words said, “This man really is the prophet that is to come in the future”.
\v 41 Some other people said, “He is the Christ”. So some other people said, “No! How will Christ come from Galilee?
\v 42 ‘Christ will be born from the line of David and he will come from David's the town of Bethlehem’ doesn't the scripture tell like that?”.
\v 43 Because of Jesus a division arose among the people.
\v 44 So some people were trying to catch him. But no one could lay a hand on him.
\s The Jewish authorities rejected putting faith on Jesus
\p
\v 45 After the temple guards returned empty handed, “Why didn't you catch him?” the chief priests and Pharisees asked.
\v 46 So the temple guards said, “Until now, no one has spoken as that man speaks”.
\v 47 So the Pharisees said, “Did he also deceive you?
\v 48 Has even one man, either from among the authorities or from the Pharisees put their faith in Jesus? No, no one has put [faith].
\v 49 But without knowing the religious law, these foolish people put their faith in him. God's curse will be on them” they told the temple guards.
\v 50 From among those who had come to Jesus earlier, a man called Nicodemus was among those authorities.
\v 51 So Nicodemus said, “Are we able to judge him according to the religious law without listening to his testimony, and without knowing what he did? Surely we cannot!” he told them.
\v 52 So they said, “Hey fool! Are you also a Galilean? Read the scripture properly. It says that no prophet will come from Galilee” they mocked.
\s A woman caught doing adultery
\p
\v 53 \f * \fr 7:53–8:11\ft This section is not in some ancient manuscripts.\f*[After that happened, they all went home.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 But Jesus went up to the Mount of Olive Trees.
\v 2 Very early in the morning on the next day, he returned to the \w temple\w*. Then many people gathered around him. So Jesus sat in order to teach them.
\v 3 Then the religious-teachers and \w Pharisees\w* brought a woman who was caught while she was committing adultery. Having made that woman stand in the middle of everyone,
\v 4 “(Respected) teacher! This woman was caught while committing adultery.
\v 5 There is a command in Moses' law that this kind of woman should be killed by stoning. So what do you say?” they asked Jesus.
\v 6 They asked Jesus this question so they could find fault in order to accuse him. But having bent down, Jesus was writing on the ground.
\v 7 They did not give up. So Jesus, having lifted his head and looking towards them said, “Whoever among you has never sinned, can throw the first stone, on this woman”.
\v 8 And he bent over again and was writing on the ground.
\v 9 Having heard that message, those who brought her, starting from the older men one after the other they went from there. So only that woman was standing before Jesus.
\v 10 So Jesus, having lifted his head once more said, “Sister! Where are the people who brought you? Didn't anyone punish you?”.
\v 11 So that woman said, “They didn't put [punishment] Lord!”. Then Jesus said, “I also do not punish you. Go from here and don't sin any more”.]
\s Jesus is the light of the world
\p
\v 12 Again Jesus said to the people, “I am like light to the people. Those who follow me do not walk in darkness. I will give them light for showing life's path”.
\v 13 So the Pharisees said, “You are testifying about yourself. We are not able to accept that testimony as true”\f * \fr 8:13 \ft According to Moses' law, in order to accept any matter, two or three testimonies are necessary.\f* they said like that.
\v 14 Then Jesus said, “[You] will have to accept the testimony I am telling as true. Because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know about that.
\v 15 You judge according to the outer appearance like ordinary people do. But I will not judge anyone in that way.
\v 16 Also, even if I judge, my judgement is true. Because while judging, the father who sent me is also with me.
\v 17 ‘Two people's witness is true’\x + \xo 8:17 \xt Deuteronomy 17:6\xt*\x* like that it is written in your religious law.
\v 18 I am the first witness and the second witness is my father who sent me” he told them.
\v 19 Then having heard they said, “Where is your father?”. So Jesus said, “You do not know either me or my father. If you knew me, you would also know my father” he told them.
\v 20 He told these words having stood near to the offering putting place inside the temple. But even then no one caught him. Because his time was yet to be fulfilled.
\s You cannot come where I go
\p
\v 21 Then once more Jesus said, “I will go. You may search for me, but you will not find me. You will die without your sins being forgiven. Because of this you cannot come where I go” he told them.
\v 22 So those Jews said, “He said we cannot come to where he goes. Perhaps he may kill himself?” they talked.
\v 23 Then Jesus, “You are all people of this world. And your thoughts are about this world. I belong to heaven. And my thoughts are different.
\v 24 For that reason I told you that you will die without your sins being forgiven. If you don't believe in what I have said about me, you will die without your sins being forgiven”.
\v 25 So they said, “Who are you, really?”. Then Jesus said, “Since the beginning I am telling who I am, and I am him.
\v 26 In order to judge you, I have many things about you. But, only those things which I heard from the one who sent me, I am telling the people of the world. Due to him being the truthful one, his judgement is true”.
\v 27 But, they did not understand that Jesus had told about his father God.
\v 28 So Jesus, “When you dangle Heaven's Man up on the log, then you will know who I am. Not only that, I cannot do anything by myself. But you will also know that whatever the father taught to me, those things I have told you.
\v 29 My sending one is with me. Due to always doing the deeds that give him joy, he will never leave me alone” told.
\v 30 Having heard these words, many people put their faith in him.
\s Abraham's lineage and Satan's lineage
\p
\v 31 Therefore Jesus said to the Jews who put faith on him, “If you walk according to my word, you will truly become my \w disciples\w*.
\v 32 Then you will know the truth.\f * \fr 8:32 \ft You will know the truthful one. He will set you free.\f* That truth will make you free” he told them.
\v 33 “We are Abraham's descendants. Until now we were not slaves to anyone. But how do you say ‘[You] will make us free’?” having said they asked Jesus.
\v 34 So Jesus said, “Every sin doing one becomes a slave to sin.
\v 35 A slave man will never be a household member. But a son is always with the household members.
\v 36 Therefore if God's son sets you free from sin, you will be truly free like household members.
\v 37 I know you are all Abraham's descendants. But even then you are looking to kill me. Because there is no place for my word inside you.
\v 38 I am telling what I have seen at my father's place. Like that you are also doing according to what you heard from your father. This is true” he told them.
\v 39 So they said, “Our father is Abraham”. Then Jesus said, “If you were Abraham's descendants, you would also do just as Abraham did.
\v 40 Due to [the fact that] I said the truth and heard from God, you are looking to kill me. But Abraham didn't do like that.
\v 41 You are doing just as your father did”. So they said, “We were not born from adultery. God is our only father” the said.
\v 42 Then Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would look at me lovingly. I did not come here by myself. God sent me.
\v 43 Due to not accepting the words which I told, you are not understanding.
\v 44 You belong to Satan's side. He is your father. You try to fulfil your father's evil desires. Having become a murderer from the beginning, he doesn't stand for truth. There really is no truth in him. He intentionally tells lies. Due to him being a liar, he is the source of lies.
\v 45 Therefore even though I tell you the truth, you do not put faith in me.
\v 46 Not even one of you can prove that I have sinned. I am telling the truth. But why do you not put your faith in me?
\v 47 God's people listen to God's words. But due to you not being God's people, you don't listen to what I told”.
\s Jesus is greater than the ancestor Abraham
\p
\v 48 Then those Jews, “Is it not true that you are a Samaritan\f * \fr 8:48 \ft Long ago some Jews married non-Jews. These people used to practice Jewish and other-peoples' rules-and-regulations, and ways of worship. Their descendants used to live separately in an area called Samaria. The Jewish people used to treat them as lower tribe.\f* and possessed by \w evil-spirits|Evil-spirit\w*?” they abused Jesus.
\v 49 So Jesus said, “I am not possessed by evil-spirits. I give honour to my father. You are not giving honour to me.
\v 50 I don't want my name to become famous. But there is one who wants honour to come to me. He is the just judge”.
\p
\v 51 “If anyone lives according to my message, he will never see death. This matter is true” he told them.
\v 52 Having heard that, those Jews said, “Now we surely know that you are possessed by an evil-spirit. Abraham and the ancient prophets also died. But even then you say ‘Anyone who lives according to my message will never see death’.
\v 53 Our father Abraham died. Are you greater than him? And those prophets also died. Who do you think you are?”.
\v 54 So Jesus said, “If I give myself honour, it is of no value. Whom you call as ‘Our God’, he is my father. He is giving me honour.
\v 55 You don't know him. But I know him. If I say I don't know him, I will also become a liar like you. But I know him, and I walk according to his message.
\v 56 Your father Abraham was happy that he would see the day of my coming. Having seen that day he was happy”.
\v 57 Then those Jews said, “You are not even fifty years old. Did you see Abraham [or what]?” they said to Jesus.
\v 58 So Jesus said, “I am\f * \fr 8:58 \ft Only God is able to say I am. According to the Jews, it was blasphemy if anyone else says that matter.\f* the one living from before Abraham was born. This matter is true”.
\v 59 Then they picked up rocks to throw forcefully on him. But Jesus having hidden went out from the temple.
\c 9
\s Jesus healing the blind-from-birth one
\p
\v 1 Like that, while they were going on the road, Jesus saw one blind-from-birth man.
\v 2 Then the \w disciples\w* said, “(Respected) teacher! The reason for him being born blind [was it because] he did sin, or did his parents?” they asked Jesus.
\v 3 So Jesus said, “Not because of his, or his parents' done sin was he born blind. But he was born as a blind person, so that God's power should be seen through him.
\v 4 Until the sun sets we must do the works of him who sent me. The night is approaching. Then no one will be able to work.
\v 5 But as long as I am in the world, I am like light to the people” he told the disciples.
\v 6 Having said like that, Jesus spat on the ground. With the spittle, having made a little mud, he applied it on the blind person's eyes.\fig |Cn01739C.jpg|col|||Jesus healing the one born blind|9:6\fig*
\v 7 Having applied it Jesus said, “Go and wash in the [man-made] pool called Siloam” he told him. Siloam means, ‘Sent one’. So, having gone and having washed, he became a seeing man.
\p
\v 8 After that happened, the neighbours and those who saw [him] while begging for alms said, “Is he the one who sat and begged for alms?”.
\v 9 “Yes! He is” some people said and, “No! He is someone else who looks like him” other people said. But he said “I am him!” he went on telling.
\v 10 So they said, “How did your sight come?”.
\v 11 Then he said, “A man called Jesus having made mud, applied it on my eyes and ‘having gone and washed in the [man-made] pool of Siloam, come,’ like that he told. Then I went and washed. So sight came to me” he told them.
\v 12 “Where is that Jesus?” they asked him. So he said, “I do not know”.
\s The Pharisees coming to know about that healing
\p
\v 13-14 Due to Jesus mixing mud and causing his sight to come on the rest day, they took the blind man who had been healed to the \w Pharisees\w*.
\v 15 The Pharisees also asked him about the matter of his sight coming. So he said, “Jesus applied mud on my eyes. So I went and washed. Then my sight came” he told them.
\v 16 Having heard this some Pharisees said, “Due to him not following the custom of the Sabbath, he does not come from God”. And some of them said, “If he is a sinner how is he able to do these kinds of miracles?”. In this way a division arose between the Pharisees.
\v 17 Then once again they said to the one whose sight came, “Due to you receiving your sight, what do you say about him?”. So he said, “He is a prophet”.
\v 18-19 Due to not believing that he was blind and sight came, those Jewish authorities called his parents. And (they asked), “Is this the blind-from-birth son that was born to you? If he was, how is it that he is now seeing?” they asked.
\v 20 So the parents said, “We know that he is the blind-from-birth son.
\v 21 But we do not know how sight came to him and who healed him. He is mature enough to tell [you] himself. You ask him this matter” they told those authorities.
\v 22 His parents told like that because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities. Because they had taken a decision earlier that if anyone accepts that Jesus is the Christ, they would excommunicate them from the community.\f * \fr 9:22 \ft In the Greek it says synagogue. In this is Jewish meeting house, called a synagogue, all the community events happen.\f*
\v 23 For that reason [his] parents said, “He is mature enough to tell. You ask him” they told them.
\p
\v 24 Therefore having called the sight-returned-one once again said, “Tell the truth. The praise for this work should come to God. Because we know that man is a sinner”.
\v 25 So he said, “I do not know if he is a sinner or not. But I know one thing. What that is, is that before this I was blind but now I am able to see”.
\v 26 But even then they said, “What did he do to you? How did sight come to you?” they asked again.
\v 27 So then he said, “Look! I already told you. But you did not listen. Why are you asking one more time? Are you wanting to also become his disciples?”.
\v 28 Then they said, “You are his disciple. We are the prophet Moses' disciples” they shamed him.
\v 29 And they said, “We know that God spoke to Moses. But we don't know where this man came from”.
\v 30 So having heard that he said, “This matter is very wondrous. You don't know where he came from but he just gave sight to my eyes.
\v 31 God does not listen to the requests of sinners. But we know that anyone who has become God's devotee, and walks according to his will, he will listen to his requests.
\v 32 Since the creation of this world until now, we have never heard of another man healing a born-blind person.
\v 33 If he did not come from God, he would not be able to do any of these kinds of works” he told them.
\v 34 Having heard that they said, “Ehe! You were born and brought up in sin. Have you come in order to teach us?” they cast him out from there.
\s Spiritual blindness
\p
\v 35 Jesus, having heard that they cast him out, having searched and found him, said, “Are you putting your faith in Heaven's Man?”.
\v 36 So the man said, “Tell me, Lord, who he is in order to put my faith in him?” he asked Jesus.
\v 37 Then Jesus said, “You are now looking at him. He is the one you are speaking with”.
\v 38 Immediately when he heard that he said, “Lord, I am putting faith” having said, he knelt down completely [to worship].
\v 39 Then Jesus said, “Blind people should see and sighted people should be blind. I have come to this world so that judgement should happen in this way\x + \xo 9:39 \xt Isaiah 6:9-10\xt*\x*”.
\v 40 So some Pharisees who heard those words said, “Are you saying that we are also blind (people)?”.
\v 41 Then Jesus said, “If you were blind people, sin would not stay with you. But due to you saying we can see, your sin still stands within you” he told them.
\c 10
\s Jesus is the good shepherd
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus said, “He who enters the sheep's pen without entering from the gate, having climbed in from the other side is a thief and looter.
\v 2 But whoever enters from the gate is the shepherd.
\v 3 The guard of the pen will open the gate for the shepherd. The sheep recognize his voice. He takes his sheep outside by calling [their] names.
\v 4 Like that, while taking his sheep outside, the shepherd always walks in front on them. Due to recognizing his voice, those sheep follow him.
\v 5 But due to not recognizing the voice of another person, having scattered they run away from him. This is true” he told them.
\p
\v 6 Having taken this example Jesus told them. But they didn't understand the meaning of what he told about.
\v 7 So once again Jesus started telling [them] like this. “This matter is true. I am like the sheep entering gate.
\v 8 Everyone who came before me were thieves and looters. Those true sheep having heard their voices did not follow.
\v 9 I am like the gate. Those [sheep] who enter through me will be saved and they keep coming in and going out without worry. Those sheep will get green grass.
\v 10 The theif comes only to steal, to kill and to destroy. But I came in order to give the sheep a new and full life.
\v 11 I am the good sheep shepherd. The good shepherd will give his own life for the sheep.
\v 12 But the hired worker is not like the true shepherd of the sheep. Due to those sheep not being his, even if he sees a wolf, he will run away. Then that wolf will attack them and scare [them] away.
\v 13 Due to a hired worker only coming only for the wage, he will run away without caring for the sheep's well-being.
\v 14-15 But I am the good shepherd. The father [knows] me and I know the father. Like that the sheep [know] me and I know my sheep. I will give my life for my sheep.
\v 16 There are other sheep [that are] mine, not only [those] belonging to this pen. I must also bring them. They will listen to my voice. Then those and these will become one flock. And there will be one shepherd for all of them.
\v 17 I am giving [up] my life in order to be raised from death [to life]. Because of this the father loves me very much.
\v 18 No one is able to take my life from me. I myself am giving [up] my life. Due to God having commanded me, I have authority to give that life and even to take it [back] once again”.
\p
\v 19 Through this message once again there was a division among the Jews.
\v 20 From among them many people said, “Due to an \w evil-spirit\w* possessing him, [he] has become even more mad. Why do you listen to his message?”.
\v 21 But some other people said, “These words are not of an evil-spirit possessed one. How could an evil-spirit give sight to blind people”.
\s Jesus saying he is God's son
\p
\v 22 During that winter, the temple entering festival\f * \fr 10:22 \ft They are doing this festival because earlier foreigners who opposed [the Jews] defiled this temple. But once again having made the temple ritually-clean in 165 years before the birth of Christ, in order to perform the original religious rites they established the Hanuk festival.\f* called Hanuk was happening in Jerusalem.
\v 23 So one day Jesus was walking in the courtyard of the \w temple\w* at Solomon's porch.
\v 24 At that time, the Jewish authorities having gathered around said, “How long will you keep us doubting? If you are the saving one Christ,\f * \fr 10:24 \fq the saving one Christ \ft The Jews were looking for Christ who was God's chosen king in order for themselves to be saved.\f* tell us openly”.
\v 25 So Jesus said, “I told you before, but you did not believe. The deeds that I have done in the father's name are testifying about me.
\v 26 But you are not people of my sheep's flock. For that reason you do not put your faith on me.
\v 27 My sheep listen to my voice. I know which are mine. They follow me.
\v 28 I will give them eternal life. They will never be destroyed. No one can snatch them from my hand.
\v 29 Because My Father has given those sheep to me. Due to my Father being greater than everyone, no one can snatch them from my father's hand.
\v 30 I and my father are one”.
\v 31 Then those Jews picked up rocks in order to hit and kill him.
\v 32 So Jesus said, “I showed you very many miracles from my father. From among them, for which deed are you going to stone me” he asked them.
\v 33 So the Jews said, “We are about to stone you with rocks not because of your good deeds, but due to [you] claiming to be God [while] being a man”.
\p
\v 34-36 Then Jesus said, “Scripture never lies. Long ago in your \w scripture\w*, it is written ‘You are like God’,\x + \xo 10:34-36 \xt Psalms 82:6\xt*\x* like that God told some judges. So, having chosen me the father, sent me to this world in order to [do] his work, then how will it be blasphemy by saying that I am God's son?
\v 37 Don't put your faith in me if I am not doing my father's works.
\v 38 But if I do those deeds, even if you don't put faith in my message, at least believe my deeds. If you do like that you will clearly know that my father is in me and I am in my father”.
\v 39 So once again they tried to catch him. But he went away from there having escaped from their hands.
\p
\v 40 Having gone to the place [where] John had first baptized him on the other side of the Jordan River, he was there.
\v 41 Then a big crowd having come to him said, “John did not do any glorious signs. But whatever John told about him, all those are true” they talked to each other.
\v 42 Many people there put their faith in Jesus.
\c 11
\s The death of Jesus' loved devotee
\p
\v 1 At a village called Bethany a man called Lazarus had fallen sick. His older-sisters Martha and Mary were also living in that village.
\v 2 This is that Mary who had applied perfume\x + \xo 11:2 \xt John 12:1-11; Mark 14:3-5\xt*\x* on the Lord, and wiped his feet with her hair. This Lazarus was their younger brother.
\v 3 Therefore those two older-sisters sent news to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love has fallen sick”.
\p
\v 4 Having heard that news Jesus said, “This sickness did not come to kill him. But having given honour to God's son, it came to bring glory to God”.
\p
\v 5 Jesus used to treat Martha, her younger sister and Lazarus lovingly.
\v 6 Jesus heard the news that Lazarus was sick. But even then, he stopped there for two more days.
\v 7 After stopping like that he said, “Let's go around the area of Judea” he said to the \w disciples\w*.
\p
\v 8 Then the disciples asked Jesus, “(Respected) teacher! The Jews from there are just now wanting to stone you. Again you want to go there?” they asked Jesus.
\p
\v 9 So Jesus said, “It will be light for twelve hours in a day.\x + \xo 11:9 \xt John 9:4-5\xt*\x* In the day time, due to having seen the light of the world, the walker will not stumble.
\v 10 But the walker, due to not having light at night, he will stumble”.
\p
\v 11 After Jesus said like this, “Our friend Lazarus is sleeping. I will go to wake him up from sleep”.
\p
\v 12 Then the disciples said, “Lord, if he is sleeping, definitely he will get up and get well!”.
\p
\v 13 Jesus spoke about Lazarus's death but the disciples thought he spoke about ordinary sleep.
\v 14 So Jesus said, “Lazarus died” having told openly,
\v 15 “It was good that I was not there. It happened like this for you. My desire is that your faith should increase. Now let's go there!” he said to them.
\v 16 Then the twin\f * \fr 11:16 \ft Twin or Didumas means either a younger sister or brother born along with him.\f* called Thomas said, “Let's also go to die along with Jesus” he said to the other disciples who were with him.
\s Jesus has power to raise the dead
\p
\v 17-19 It was two miles (3 kilometres) distance from Jerusalem to the nearby village of Bethany. Many Jews had come to comfort Martha and Mary [who were] very sad due to their younger brother's death. So after Jesus reached near that village, he came to know that having put Lazarus' body in the carved rock tomb, four days had passed.
\v 20 Martha, having heard that Jesus was coming, went out to meet [him] on the way. But Mary stayed at home.
\v 21 Martha having met Jesus said, “Lord! If you had been here my younger brother would not have died.
\v 22 But it's not a problem even now. Whatever you ask to God, [he] will also give you”.
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus said, “Your younger brother will rise (to life)”.
\p
\v 24 So Martha said, “Yes Lord, I know that he will \w rise|Raising back to life\w* again on judgement doing day”.
\p
\v 25 Having heard that Jesus said, “I am the raiser [of the dead is implied] and I am [the] life. If anyone puts his faith in me, even if he dies, he will live again.
\v 26 Being alive, those who believe in me will not have the forever death punishment.\x + \xo 11:26 \xt John 5:28-29 \xt*\x* Do you believe this?”.
\p
\v 27 So she said, “Yes Lord! You are God's son Christ and you were to come to this world. I believe this”.
\p
\v 28-30 Jesus had not yet entered the village. He stopped there where Martha had met [him]. Then, Martha went home and having quietly called Mary said, “The teacher came. He is calling you” she said to her younger sister. Mary, having heard this message, immediately got up and went to Jesus.
\v 31 Some Jews were in the house comforting Mary. Then having seen her hurriedly get up and go, maybe she has gone to cry at the tomb like that they followed her.
\v 32 Mary having gone to the place Jesus was, having fallen at his feet said, “Lord! If you had been here my younger brother would not have died”.
\p
\v 33 Mary and all the Jews coming with her, having seen her crying, Jesus' heart was deeply sad.
\v 34 Then Jesus said, “Where did you put his body?”. So they said, “Lord, come and see”.
\p
\v 35 Having heard that, Jesus shed tears.
\v 36 Having seen that those Jews said, “See how much he loved Lazarus”.
\p
\v 37 Some people from among them said, “This Jesus caused sight to come to blind people. So, couldn't he have kept this Lazarus from dying [or what]?”.
\s Jesus raising the dead Lazarus [to life]
\p
\v 38 Once again Jesus' heart was troubled. So he went to the tomb. It was a carved rock tomb. A rock was kept to block it.
\v 39 So Jesus said, “Remove that rock!” he told them. Then the dead one's older sister Martha said, “Lord, his dead body having rotted, there will now be a smell coming. Because it is the fourth days since he died”.
\p
\v 40 Then Jesus said, “If you put faith, you will see God's glory, didn't I tell you that?”.
\p
\v 41 So they removed that rock. Then Jesus looking up said, “Father, I thank you due to you hearing my prayer.
\v 42 I know you are always listening to my prayers. But I said this for them so that those around me should believe, that you sent me”.
\p
\v 43 After saying like this Jesus (shouted), “Lazarus, come outside!” he called loudly. \fig |CN01769C.TIF|col|||Raising Lazarus to life with the power of God|11:43\fig*
\p
\v 44 Then Lazarus came out, along with the cloths that had wrapped around his dead-body. His face was wrapped with a hand towel. “Release him, having unwrapped the cloths” Jesus told.
\s The Jews making plans to kill Jesus
\r (Matthew 26:1-5; Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2)
\p
\v 45 Having seen that deed, many of the Jews who had come to comfort Mary, put their faith in Jesus.
\p
\v 46 But some people from among them, having gone to the \w Pharisees\w*, told about the deed Jesus had done.
\v 47 Therefore the chief priests and Pharisees called the council members and said, “What shall we do? That man is doing many glorious signs.
\v 48 If we just watching him do like this, everyone, calling him king, will put their faith in him. Then the Roman kingdom's authorities having come, will destroy our temple and chase our people out from here”.
\v 49-50 Immediately, “You fools! In order for our people not to be destroyed, don't you realize that it is good for one man to give [his] life for the people?” said Caiaphas, who was the High Priest at that time.
\p
\v 51-52 It is not only for the benefit of the Jews. But in order to gather together all Gods people who are spread over the world, Jesus will give his life, he told like that what would happen in the future. He did not tell this message by himself. But due to him being the High Priest that year he was able to tell.
\v 53 From that day onwards they started planning to kill him.
\v 54 Therefore from then onwards, without roaming around openly among the Jews, having gone to a town called Ephraim near the wilderness, Jesus was there for a few days with his disciples.
\p
\v 55-57 Then the Jewish Passover festival was approaching. So, “If anyone knows Jesus whereabouts, they must tell. We will catch him” that-like the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command. Before the festival many people came to Jerusalem from the neighbouring villages in order to purify themselves for the festival. Searching for Jesus, having stood in the \w temple\w* they said, “Will he or won't he come for this festival? What do you say?” they asked each other.
\c 12
\s Pouring scent on Jesus at Bethany
\r (Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9)
\p
\v 1 Six days before the Passover Festival, Jesus came to Bethany village of Lazarus who died and \w rose|Raising back to life\w* [to life].
\v 2 There they prepared a meal for him. Martha served. And Lazarus also sat along with the eating ones.
\v 3 Then Mary came having held about half a litre of very pure and valuable scent\f * \fr 12:3 \ft Oil from the tree called ‘acca jatamansi’.\f* and having poured it on Jesus feet, she dried it with her hair. The smell of that scent permeated the whole house.
\v 4 Then one of the \w disciples\w* called Judas of Iscariot village the one who [would] hand Jesus over, said,
\v 5 “Hey! Why did you not give to the poor, having sold this scent for three hundred silver coins\f * \fr 12:5 \ft The value of one silver coin was the same as one day's wage.\f*?” he said to her.
\v 6 He didn't say that due to care of helping the poor. But due to his stealing mind and being the money bag keeper he said like that as he was stealing money from there.
\v 7 So Jesus said, “She was keeping that scent for the day of my burial.
\v 8 Poor people will always be in your midst. But I will not always be in your midst in bodily form”.
\p
\v 9 At that time, having known that Jesus is there, very many Jewish people, came not only to see Jesus [but] also Lazarus who Jesus raised [to life].
\v 10-11 From among the Jews many people put their faith in Jesus because of Lazarus. Therefore the chief priests made a plan to also kill Lazarus.
\s Jesus receiving praise entering Jerusalem
\r (Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40)
\p
\v 12-13 A big crowd, came for the festival, having heard that Jesus would come to Jerusalem, they went [to meet] him on the way having holding palm branches. Having gone like that they said, “Hail!\f * \fr 12:12-13 \fq Hail! \ft In Greek it says “Hosanna”. This means “save now!”\f* May God bless Israel's king who comes with the authority\f * \fr 12:12-13 \fq with the authority of \ft or it says, in the name of.\f* of the Lord” they shouted.
\v 14-15 “Don't be afraid people of Jerusalem!\f * \fr 12:14-15 \ft They also call them people of Zion.\f* Look, your king is coming seated on a donkey” as it was written in the scripture, Jesus sat and is coming on a donkey.\f * \fr 12:14-15 \ft In the Greek language it says on a young donkey.\f*
\v 16 While these things were happening, the disciples did not realize. But after Jesus had gone to heaven with glory, they realized that all these things happened exactly as written in the scripture.
\v 17 Those people who were with him while Jesus was raising Lazarus's dead-body [to life] proclaimed this testimony. \fig |CN01782C.jpg|col|||Jesus entering Jerusalem|12:17\fig*
\v 18 Due to people hearing that, Jesus did this miracle they went to meet him on the way.
\v 19 For that reason the \w Pharisees\w* said, “Look! Our plans are useless. All the people of the world are following him” they spoke amongst themselves.
\s Jesus telling about his death
\p
\v 20 During the festival there were also some non-Jews\f * \fr 12:20 \fq non-Jews \ft it has Greek country people.\f* among those who came in order to worship.
\v 21 They, having met Philip of Bethsaida village in Galilee area said, “Sir! We came in order to meet Jesus” they told him.
\v 22 Philip went and told this to Andrew. The two of them went together and told that to Jesus.
\v 23 Having heard that Jesus said, “The time is near for glory to come to Heaven's Man.
\v 24-26 If a seed of wheat is not planted in the ground it will remain as one. While planting that seed, it appears as dead. But from the ground that seed sprouts up, and having matured, it will give a full head of wheat seeds. In that way, only if I give my life, many people will get new life. Like that if anyone from among you loves his own life, will lose that life. But if anyone doesn't care for the worldly desires, he is able to save his own life in order to live forever. [Whoever] wants to serve me should walk in my way. Then where I will be there my serving-one will also be. My father will honour my service-doing one. This is true” he said to the disciples.
\p
\v 27 “Now my heart is becoming completely anxious. What will I say? My father! Save me from this bad-incident coming on me. But even then, I came to bear this bad-incident.
\v 28 Oh father! Cause honour come to your name”. Then from above,\f * \fr 12:28 \ft Meaning from heaven or from the sky.\f* “Earlier I caused honour to come. And again I will cause honour to come” one voice was heard.
\v 29 So having heard that some people who were standing there said, “It thundered”. Some other people said, “An angel of God spoke with him”.
\v 30 Therefore Jesus said, “The sound of this voice did not come in order to help me. It came in order to help you.
\v 31 The time has come for judging this world's people. The time has come for casting out the one in authority controlling this world.
\v 32 When they lift me up from the earth, then I will draw everyone to my side”.
\v 33 He spoke this matter about how his own death would happen.
\p
\v 34 So the crowd of people said, “We heard from scripture that ‘Christ will be alive forever’. But how can you say that Heaven's Man will be lifted up from the earth to be killed? Who is this Heaven's Man?” they asked Jesus.
\v 35 Then Jesus said, “[The] light will be among you for a little more time. Before the darkness spreads, walk in [the] light. Then you will not stumble. The one who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.
\v 36 In order for you to become descendants of the light, put your faith in this light while it is there” Jesus told them. Having told them like that, he went off far from their sight.
\s Many people did not put their faith in Jesus
\p
\v 37 Jesus did many miraculous deeds in front of them but even then, they did not put their faith in him.
\q1
\v 38 “God! No one has put faith in the news we told.
\q2 God! No one recognized your power”\x + \xo 12:38 \xt Isaiah 53:1\xt*\x*
\m like-that what the prophet Isaiah wrote to be fulfilled, it happened like this.
\v 39 Because they were not able to put their faith, the prophet Isaiah wrote this in another place:
\q1
\v 40 “Due to closing their sight,
\q2 they are not able to see.
\q1 Due to closing their mind,
\q2 they are not able to understand.
\q1 Otherwise, they would turn towards me.
\q2 I would heal them”\x + \xo 12:40 \xt Isaiah 6:10\xt*\x*
\m like-that it is.
\v 41 Due to the prophet Isaiah having seen the future of Jesus' glory, he told these words about him.
\p
\v 42 But even then, there were many people of authority among those who put their faith in Jesus. But fearing that the Pharisees may cast them out of the community, they did not openly admit it.
\v 43 They loved the honour that people gave even more than the honour that God gave.
\s Jesus words judging the people
\p
\v 44 Then Jesus loudly said, “He who puts his faith in me is not only putting his faith in me but also on him who sent me.
\v 45 He who sees me is seeing the one who sent me.
\v 46 I have come like a light to this world, [so that] every one who puts his faith in me will not stand in darkness.
\v 47 I will not judge anyone who having heard my words, is not following them. I did not come in order to judge this world's people. But I came to save [them].
\v 48 There is one other thing to judge he who does not accept me and my words. The word I told will judge him on the judgement doing day.
\v 49 Because I have not spoken with my [own] desire, but the father who sent me commanded me what to speak about.
\v 50 And due to me knowing that that command leads to eternal life, I am telling you I said everything just as my father also told me”.
\c 13
\s Jesus washing his disciples feet
\p
\v 1 Before the Passover festival Jesus knew that the time for returning back from the world to [his] father was near. He really loved his own ones in the world. Until the end he showed them that love completely.
\v 2 But even before the meal, Satan had put the thought into the heart of Simon's son, Judas of Iscariot village, that he should betray Jesus.
\v 3 That the father had given all authority into his hands, that he came from God and was going back to God, Jesus also knew all these things.
\v 4 Due to knowing that, having got up from among them, he put his shawl to one side and having taken a towel he tied it to his waist.
\v 5 After he tied [it], he poured water into a large plate and having washed his \w disciples\w* feet, he started wiping their feet with the towel tied [at his] waist. \fig |cn01800C.jpg|col|||Jesus washing the disciples' feet|13:5\fig*
\v 6 Doing like that Jesus came to Simon-Peter. Then he said, “Lord are you going to wash my feet?”.
\v 7 So Jesus said, “[What] I am doing now you don't understand, but you will understand in the coming time”.
\v 8 Then Peter said, “[I] don't want Lord! You will never wash my feet” he said. So Jesus said, “Without me washing you, you are not part with me” he told Peter.
\v 9 So Simon Peter said, “Lord! Don't wash only my feet but also my hands and my head”.
\v 10 Then Jesus said, “For he who has bathed, it is enough to wash the feet. He doesn't have to wash anything else. He is clean. You are also clean, but not everyone among you is clean”.
\v 11 Due to him knowing who was going to betray him Jesus said, “not everyone among you is clean” he said.
\p
\v 12 And having washed their feet, having put his own shawl on his neck, went and sat at the place where he was sitting before. Like that having sat he said, “Do you understand the meaning of the deed I just did?” he asked the disciples.
\v 13 “You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’. Due to me being teacher and Lord, calling like this is right.
\v 14 Even though I am Lord and I am teacher, due to [me] washing your feet, you also must wash one another's feet.
\v 15-16 A slave is not greater than his master. Like that a \w messenger|Apostles\w* is not greater than one who sent him. I have shown you as an example that as I washed your feet you also should do. This is true.
\v 17 Now due to you knowing all these things, if you walk according to them, God will give you blessing”.
\s Jesus telling about his own betrayal
\r (Matthew 26:20-25; Mark 14:17-21; Luke 22:21-23)
\p
\v 18 “I have not told [this] about all of you. I know about those I chose. But, ‘he who ate bread with me, having become my enemy, betrayed me’ in order to fulfil the matter [written] in the \w scripture\w*, it will happen like this.
\v 19 After these [things] happen, you will believe that ‘I am Christ’ I am telling you in advance.
\v 20 This is true. If anyone receieves who I send, they also receive me. I am telling that the one receiving me also receives that father who sent me”.
\p
\v 21 After saying these words Jesus, having become troubled in [his] spirit, “One from among you will hand me over to enemies. This testimony is true” he said.
\v 22 The disciples not knowing who he was talking about, looked at each other.
\v 23 The one Jesus loved from among the disciples was sitting very near the right side of Jesus.
\v 24 So Simon-Peter said to that disciple, “Ask Jesus whom he told about” he motioned (with his hand).
\v 25 Then the disciple near Jesus leaned a little closer, “Lord! Who is he?”.
\v 26 So Jesus said, “Having dipped it in the bowl, whoever I give a piece of bread to, it is he”. Having told like that having dipped a piece of bread he gave it to Simon's son, Judas of Iscariot village.
\v 27-30 Then after taking the bread piece, (Jesu said), “Quickly do the work you are about to do” Jesus told him. Why Jesus said like that to him, nobody knew from among those seated. Due to Judas having the money bag, some of them (people) thought perhaps Jesus told [him], ‘Buy the things needed for the festival’. Others thought perhaps he said ‘Give something to the poor people’. After he had taken the bread piece, Satan possessed him, and he went outside. By then it had become night.
\s Jesus giving a new command
\r (Matthew 26:31-35; Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34)
\p
\v 31 After Judas went Jesus said, “Now the time has come for Heaven's Man to be honoured. Through him praise will come to God.
\v 32 If honour comes through the son to God, God will give honour to his son. He will immediately give that honour to his son.
\v 33 You my sons! I will be with you for a litle while more. After that you will search for me. But just as I said to the Jews I am also telling you that where I am going you cannot come now.
\v 34 Now I am giving you a new command. Just as I loved you, you should love one another.
\v 35 Through your loving one another, everyone will know you are my disciples” Jesus told.
\p
\v 36 Simon-Peter said “Lord! Where will you go?”. So Jesus said, “You cannot come to the place I am now going. But afterwards you will come”.
\v 37 Then Peter, “Lord! Why can't I come? I am even ready to give my life for you”.
\v 38 Then Jesus said, “Ehe! You will give your life for me? Within this night, before the rooster crows, you will lie three times about me saying ‘I don't know who he is’. This is true” he told Peter.
\c 14
\s Jesus is the way leading to the father
\p
\v 1 “You don't let your hearts be troubled. Put your faith in God and also put your faith in me.
\v 2 My father's house has many rooms. I am going ahead in order to keep them ready for you. I would not have told you if [it was] not so.
\v 3 After having gone to prepare a place for you, in order for you to also be there where I am, having come back I will also take you.
\v 4 You know the way to the place I am going” he told them.
\v 5 Then Thomas said, “Lord! We don't know where you will go. So how should we know the way to come there?”.
\v 6 Then Jesus said, “I am the way, [I am] the truth, and [I am] the life. No one can come to the father without me.
\v 7 If you recognized me, you would also recognize my father. Now you have seen him and you know him”.
\p
\v 8 Then Philip said, “Show us the father, Lord. That's enough for us”.
\v 9 So Jesus said to Philip, “Don't you recognize me even though I am with you until now? If [you] have seen me, it's as if [you] have seen the father. How are you asking ‘Show us the father’ like that?
\v 10 Don't you believe that I am with the father and the father is with me? I am not telling you words with my wish. The father who is in me is causing to do his deeds.
\v 11 You believe that I am with the father and the father is with me. If you don't believe according to what I said, then at least believe having seen the miracles I did.
\v 12 By my going to the father, he who puts [his] faith in me will do the miracles [that] I did. He will do even greater works than I did. This matter is true.
\v 13 What you ask in my name in order to bring honour to the father through the son I will do that which you request.
\v 14 Whatever you request in my name I will do that.
\s Jesus telling about the Holy Spirit
\p
\v 15 “If you love me, you will walk according to my command.
\v 16 I will request to the father that for helping you [he] sends one instead of me in order to be with you forever.
\v 17 That helper is the Holy Spirit. That [spirit] will tell you about the truth. Through that you know God's spirit. Now that spirit is with you and later [it] will be inside you. But the people of the world do not see it and do not know it. Therefore they do not accept that spirit.
\p
\v 18 “I will not leave you like orphans. I will come to you.
\v 19 In some more days the people of this world will not see me any more. But you will see me. Because as I live, you will also live.
\v 20 On that day you will know that I am in the father, you are in me, and I am in you.
\v 21 [He who] accepts my commands and, lives according to them loves me. [He who] loves me, the father loves [him]. I will love and reveal myself to him”.
\v 22 Then Judas (not Judas of Iscariot village) said, “Lord! Why do you say ‘I will appear’ only to us, not to the world?” he asked Jesus.
\v 23 So Jesus said, “The one who loves me lives according to my message. My father loves that kind of person. Having come, we will live in him.
\v 24 But he who does not love me, does not live according to my word. The words you hear are not mine, but they are my father's who sent me.
\v 25 I told you these things while I was with you.
\v 26 But the father is sending the \w Holy Spirit\w* in my name to teach you everything. And it will also remind you of everything I told.
\p
\v 27 “Having given you peace, I will go. I am giving my peace\f * \fr 14:27 \ft This is God's peace - see \xt Ezekiel 37:24-28\xt*\f* to you. I am not giving as the world is giving you. Don't allow your hearts to be troubled and don't be afraid.
\v 28 ‘Having gone, I will come to you’ you heard the message [I] said. Due the father being more honoured compared to me, if you love me, you will be very happy saying that he is going to the father.
\v 29 I am telling you these words before it happens, so that you will believe.
\v 30 The ruler of this world, Satan, is coming. Therefore I will not speak with you much longer. He has no authority over me.
\v 31 But, in order for the world's people to know that I am loving the father, I am doing like this\f * \fr 14:31 \ft Meaning that I hand myself over so that Satan would cause to the people of the world to kill me.\f* according to the father's command. Let us get up! Let us go from here”.
\c 15
\s Jesus is the true vine
\p
\v 1 While the disciples were going with Jesus said, “I am the true grape vine. My father is the master of that vineyard.
\v 2 \fig |HK00108C.TIF|col|||Grapevine|15:2\fig* My father will cut and throw away those branches that having sprouted from me which are not bearing grapes. He will cut the tips of the fruit bearing branches a little so that they bear fruit even more.
\v 3 Through the message I told you, having cut the tips of the branches, and having become pure, you are ready.
\v 4 Remain united with me. I will be in you. Just as a grape branch does not bear fruit without being joined to the vine, like that you cannot do good works without remaining united with me.
\p
\v 5 “I am the grape vine. You are the sprouted branches in me. Whoever stays in me and I stay in him, he will do even more good works. Having been broken from me you cannot do anything.
\v 6 Whoever does not stay in me, he will dry up just as a branch having been cut off and thrown dries up. Men gather up and throw those kinds of dried branches into the fire and those burn up.
\v 7 If you are in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want. You will get that.
\v 8 Glory will come to my father through your good works. Seeing these others will know that you are my \w disciples\w*.
\v 9 How the father loved me, like that I loved you. Remain in my love.
\v 10 In the way that I live according to the father's commands, and remain in his love, in the same way if you live according to my commands, you will remain in my love.
\v 11 I am telling you these words so that my happiness should be in you and that happiness should be full.
\p
\v 12 “In the way that I have loved you, you should also love one another. This is my command.
\v 13 There is no one who loves more than he who gives up his life for his friends.
\v 14 If you live according to my command, you will become my friends.
\v 15 From now on I don't call you slaves, I call you friends. Because the slaves don't know the master's plan. But I told you all the words I heard from my father.
\v 16 You did not choose me, but I, having chosen you, appointed you. It is my desire that you should do good works of [making] everlasting fruit. If you do that you will get whatever you request the father in my name.
\v 17 I gave you this command, that you should love one another.
\s The world's people will hate you
\p
\v 18 “If the people of the world hate you, remember that before you, they hated me.
\v 19 If you had been like the people of the world, they would like you. But you are not people of the world. Because I have chosen you from among the people of the world. For that reason the people of this world hate you.
\v 20 Remember the matter I said [to you] just before this, ‘A slave is not greater than his master’. Due to people having persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they follow according to my word, they will also follow according to your word.
\v 21 Due to them not knowing the father who sent me, because of me they will do all these [things] to you.
\p
\v 22 “If I had not come to tell them the teaching, they would not remain under the guilt of sin. But, due to me coming, there is no chance for them to escape from their guilt.
\v 23 He who hates me, also hates my father.
\v 24 If I hadn't done those miraculous-signs that no one else can do, the guilt of sin would not remain in them. But they saw the miraculous-signs I did. But even then they hate my father and me.
\v 25 ‘Without even any reason they hate me’ it happened in order to fulfil the word of scripture.
\v 26 From the father I will send the Holy Spirit to help you. After it comes, it will tell you the true testimony about me.
\v 27 You also will testify about me. Because you were with me from the beginning.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 “I told you these things so you should not slide away from [the] faith.
\v 2 They will cast you out from the community.\f * \fr 16:2 \fq from the community \ft In the Greek language it has ‘from the synagogues’.\f* The time is coming when each one will think they are serving their God by killing you all.
\v 3 They will do like this due to them not knowing the father or me.
\v 4 I am telling you that while it is happening like this, you will remember that I told you about these earlier.
\s The deeds of the Holy Spirit
\p “Due to being with you until now, I did not tell about these things earlier.
\v 5 But now I am going to the father who sent me. But even then, not even one from among you (asks), ‘Where will you go?’ is asking.
\v 6 Due to me telling you these words, your hearts are filled with sadness.
\v 7 [Only] If I go you will get the benefit. Without me going, the staying with you helping Holy Spirit will not come to you. If I go, I will send that spirit to you. This is true.
\v 8 That Holy Spirit having come, will show the people of the world about sin, about righteousness and about judgement.
\v 9 The Holy Spirit will show them they have sinned due to not putting faith on me.
\v 10 Due to I going to the father\f * \fr 16:10 \ft Having gone to the father God and sat on the right hand side of God, he rules. (\xt Hebrews 8:1\xt*) Sitting in this way, shows that he is the righteous one (\xt 1 John 2:1-2\xt*).\f* and you not seeing me from now on, the Holy Spirit will show that I am righteous.
\v 11 The authority of this world, Satan, has been judged. Therefore the Holy Spirit shows that God will also judge the people of this world.
\v 12 There are many other things for me to tell you, but you cannot bear them.
\v 13 That Holy Spirit having come will tell about the truth. It will lead you towards complete truth. It does not tell anything of its own. It tells those things it has heard. It will also tell about things to happen in the future.
\v 14 Due to that Spirit having taken and told you of the things I spoke, honour will come to me.
\v 15 Everything that is with the father is also mine. Therefore I said that, having taken from what I have told, the Holy Spirit will tell.
\s Sadness gone and happiness coming
\p
\v 16 “After a few days you will not see me. But a few days later you will see me” he told the disciples.
\v 17 Having heard this message, some of the \w disciples\w* said, “‘After a few days you will not see me. But a few days later you will see me. I will go to my father’ for what is he talking with us?” they spoke to each other.
\v 18 “What is he telling about ‘after a few days’? We are not understanding the meaning of the matter he is telling”.
\p
\v 19 Jesus having known the matter that they were about to ask said, “Are you yourselves talking about the matter that was said ‘After a few days you will not see me. But a few days later you will see me’?” he asked them back.
\v 20 And he said, “You will cry with sadness, but the world will be happy. You will cry, but your sadness will be turned to happiness. This is true.
\v 21 Due to the delivery time coming, a woman bears the labour pains. When she gives birth to a baby, then with the joy of giving birth to a life in this world, she forgets the labour pains she bore.
\v 22 Like that you are now suffering. But I will see you once again. Then no one will be able to take away the happiness in your hearts.
\v 23 During that time you won't need to ask me anything” he told them.
\p Then Jesus said, “If you request the father for anything in my name [he] will give it to you. This is true.
\v 24 Until now you have not requested anything in my name. Keep on asking for your happiness to be complete. You will definitely be given.
\v 25 I told you these things as examples. But I will no longer tell any more examples. The time is coming for me to tell clearly in order for you to understand about the father.
\v 26-28 I came from the father to this world. Now having left the world I am going to the father. The father is loving you, due to you having loved me and put faith that I came from God. At that time I will not have to request the father for you. But you will request in my name. He will give to you” he told them.
\p
\v 29 Then the disciples said, “Look! Now you are telling openly without examples.
\v 30 It is not necessary for anyone to ask questions. Now we know that you know everything. Through this we believe that you have come from God”.
\v 31 So Jesus said, “Are you now really believing in me?
\v 32 Look! The time is coming [when] having left me alone, you will all run away. That time has now come, but even then I am not alone. The father is with me.
\v 33 I am telling these things [so] that through me peace should come to you. Persecution will come to you in the world. But I have won-over all of these. Therefore be with courage”.
\c 17
\s Jesus praying
\p
\v 1-4 Having said these things, Jesus looking up towards the sky prayed like this: “Father! You have given me authority over all the people in the world. Through this I am able to give eternal life to whoever you gave to me. Those who know you [are] the only true God and Jesus Christ [whom] you sent will get eternal life. I brought glory to you having completed all the works you gave me to do on earth. That time has now come. Cause your glory come to me. In this way I will cause glory to come to you.
\v 5 Oh Father! What kind of glory there was when I was with you before the creation of this world, let that kind of glory to come to me now.
\s Jesus praying for his disciples
\p
\v 6 “I have made you known to those people that you gave me from this world. Those people were yours, but you handed them over to me. They have lived according to your word.
\v 7-8 I have told them the message you gave to me. Having accepted that, they believe that you sent me. They have come to know that I have truly come from you. So, they have now come to know that you gave me all the power to speak and do miraculous deeds.
\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for the people of the world. Due to those whom you gave to me being yours, I am praying for them.
\v 10 All those who are with me are yours and you gave them to me. Through them putting faith on me, honour came to me.
\v 11 I will not be in the world any more. But they are in the world. I am coming to you. Holy-one father God! Just as we are united now, they should also be united, so protect them with the power of your name [that] you gave me.
\v 12 While I was here, I protected those you gave me with the power of your name. To fulfil the word of \w scripture\w*, whoever who was to be destroyed, he was destroyed.
\v 13 Now I am coming to you. I am telling these things while I am in this world so that my joy should completely be with them.
\v 14 I have told your word to them. I am not of this world. Like that, due to them also not being people of this world, the people of this world hate them.
\v 15 I am not praying to you that you should take them from this world. But I am praying that you protect them from the evil one called Satan.
\v 16 Just as I am not of the world, like that they also are not people of this world.
\v 17 Your word is true. With that truth, set them apart to do your service.
\v 18 In the way that you sent me into the world, in that way I sent them into the world.
\v 19 It is my desire that through the sacrifice that I myself become, they should become truly holy and serve you.
\s Jesus praying for all believers
\p
\v 20 “I am praying not only for these disciples, but for whoever puts their faith in me having heard their message.
\v 21 Oh father! I in you, you in me - how we are united, like that all the trusting ones should also be united, like that I am praying. Unite them in us so that the people of the world will know that you have sent me.
\v 22-23 You are in me. I am in them. I gave them the glory that you gave to me. Just as we are united now, they are also be united. Then the people of the world will know that you sent me and that just as you loved me, you are loving them.

\v 24 “Father! I am requesting that those you gave to me, should, along with me, see the glory that you gave to me. Because, from before the creation of the world, you loved me.
\v 25 Righteous father! The people of this world are not knowing you, but I know you. These disciples knew that you sent me.
\v 26 I have been showing them who you are and I will show even more. You loved me. Like that it is my desire that I myself should be in their hearts, and they also should love me” he prayed.

\s Capturing Jesus
\r (Matthew 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53)
\p
\v 1 After Jesus prayed, he crossed over the Kidron stream's valley with his disciples. There was a garden there. He and his \w disciples\w* entered that garden.
\v 2 Jesus and his disciples had gone there many times. Therefore Judas, the betraying and handing Jesus over to others one, also knew that garden.
\v 3 The chief priests and \w Pharisees\w*, having chosen some people sent [them] with Judas. Who these were, Judas, some soldiers and temple guards. They came with burning torches, lamps and weapons.
\v 4 Due to Jesus knowing in advance what was to happen to himself, having gone to them said, “Who are you searching for?”.
\v 5-6 Then they said, “For Jesus of Nazareth”. So Jesus said, “I am him”. Having heard that message, they moved back and fell down along with Judas, the betrayer.
\v 7 Once again Jesus said, “Who are you searching for?” he asked them. So they said, “For Jesus of Nazareth”.
\v 8 So Jesus said, “I told you just before this that I am him. Due to you searching for me, allow the remaining ones to go”.
\v 9 Because, ‘Not even one was lost from among those given to me’ like-that in order to fulfil the word he had told, he said like this.
\v 10 There was a long knife with Simon-Peter. With that he cut off the right ear of the servant of the High Priest called Malchus.
\v 11 Then Jesus said, “Put your knife in its sheath. Should I not bear the troubles that my father has given me to bear?” he said to Peter.
\v 12 Then those soldiers and their officer, and the Jewish temple guards took Jesus first to the high priest called Annas.
\v 13 That Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was doing the High Priest's service at that time.
\v 14 ‘So that our tribe is not destroyed, one man dying for all the people is better’\x + \xo 18:14 \xt John 11:49-50 \xt*\x* like-that this Caiaphas was the one who had instructed the Jews.
\s Peter lying that he does not know who Jesus is
\r (Matthew 26:69-70; Mark 14:66-68; Luke 22:55-57)
\p
\v 15 Like that while they were taking Jesus, Simon-Peter and another disciple followed them. Due to that disciple knowing the High Priest, he went inside the courtyard of the High Priest's house along with Jesus.
\v 16 But Peter was standing outside at the gate of the High Priest's house. Therefore that disciple having turned back, and having spoken to the girl guarding the gate, brought Peter inside.
\v 17 That gate guarding girl said, “You are one from among his disciples, aren't you?” she asked Peter. So Peter, said, “I am not”.
\v 18 Due to it been cold at that time, the servants and temple guards having lit a fire were warming [themselves]. So Peter also having gone was warming [himself] along with them.
\s The High Priest asking questions to Jesus
\r (Matthew 26:59-66; Mark 14:55-64; Luke 22:66-71)
\p
\v 19 At that time the High Priest Annas, asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
\v 20 So Jesus said, “I have openly taught in front of everyone in the synagogues and \w temple\w* where the Jews gather. I have not taught anything secretly. \fig |cn01815C.jpg|col|||The priests questioning Jesus|18:20\fig*
\v 21 Why are you asking me this question? Ask those who heard what I taught. Look! They know what I said”.
\v 22 When Jesus answered like that, one of the temple guards who was standing nearby said, “Do you answer a High Priest like that?” he slapped [him] on the cheek.
\v 23 Then Jesus said, “Tell if I have spoken anything wrong. If [I] having spoken properly, why did you hit me?” he asked the temple guard.
\v 24 Then Annas, without untying the ropes that tied Jesus, sent [him] to the current High Priest called Caiaphas.
\s The rooster crowing just when Peter lies
\r (Matthew 26:71-75; Mark 14:69-72; Luke 22:58-62)
\p
\v 25 Having seen Simon-Peter while he was warming himself at the fire, they said, “You really are one from among his disciples aren't you?”. So Peter, said, “I am not. I don't know him”.
\v 26 But a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off was a servant of the High Priest. That servant said, “Didn't I see you while you were with Jesus in the garden?” he said to Peter.
\v 27 Then Peter said, “I don't know” one more time he said. Just then a rooster crowed.
\s Jesus before the Governor Pilate
\r (Matthew 27:1-2,11-31; Mark 15:1-20; Luke 23:1-25)
\p
\v 28 At daybreak, they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor's palace. So that they would not defile themselves, they did not enter the palace, so they could eat the Passover feast.
\v 29 So Pilate having come outside said, “What accusation are you putting on this man?”.
\v 30 Then they said, “Why would we come to you if he hadn't done wrong?”.
\v 31-32 So Pilate, said, “You having taken him, judge him according to your religious law”. Having heard that the Jews said, “None of us have the authority like you do to give someone else the death sentence”. Through that Jesus' word about what kind of death he would be getting was fulfilled.
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate having gone inside the palace, called Jesus (and said), “Are you the king of the Jews?”.
\v 34 So Jesus said, “Are you saying like this yourself? Or did some others tell you about me?” he asked back.
\v 35 Therefore Pilate said, “Am I a Jew or what? Your people and the chiefs Priests sent you to me. What did you do?”.
\v 36 Then Jesus said, “My kingdom is not about this world. If my kingdom was about this world my servants would have fought to stop the Jews capturing me. But my kingdom is not of here”.
\v 37 Having heard that Pilate said, “So, are you a king?”. So Jesus said, “You said to me ‘You are a king’. I was born to testify about the truth. It is for this reason that I came into the world. Those who love the truth listen to my message”.
\v 38 So Pilate said, “What does truth mean?” he asked mockingly.
\p And having gone to the Jewish people outside, said, “To me there appears to be no wrong-doing in him.
\v 39 But while your Passover festival is happening, there is a custom running that I release one from among those in prison. So would you like to release this king of the Jews?”.
\v 40 Then they (shouted) loudly, “No, not him, but release Barabbas” they shouted. That Barabbas having looted had fallen into jail.
\c 19
\s Giving Jesus the death punishment
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate caused Jesus to be beaten with whips.
\v 2 \fig |AB02861b.jpg|col|||Crown of thorns|19:2\fig* The soldiers having wrapped thorns around [made] like a crown, and put it on Jesus' head. They put a purple cloak that kings wear on him.
\v 3 Like that after putting it on, having come close to him they said, “King of the Jews! Hail to you”, like-that they slapped [him].
\p
\v 4 Pilate having come outside once again said, “I will bring him before you. But, listen! I don't see any wrong in him deserving punishment”.
\v 5 They brought Jesus outside wearing the crown of thorns and that purple cloak. Then Pilate said, “Look! Look at this man!”.
\v 6 Having seen Jesus, those chief priests and temple guards said, “Having nailed him on the log, kill him! Kill him!” they shouted. So Pilate said, “To me there appears no wrong-doing in him. Therefore you nail him on the log and kill him”.
\v 7 Having heard that, those Jews said, “There is one law for us. Due to him saying ‘I am God's son’, according to our law he must surely die”.
\v 8 Having heard that, Pilate was very afraid.
\p
\v 9 And having taken Jesus into the palace, Pilate asked, “Where have you come from?” he asked him. But Jesus did not answer.
\v 10 So Pilate said, “Why don't you speak with me? I have the authority to set you free and also to cause you to be nailed to the log and killed” he said with Jesus.
\v 11 Then Jesus said, “You don't have any authority over me except for what is given from God who is above. Therefore the one who caused me to be handed over to you, will have very much sin attached”.
\p
\v 12 From then on Pilate tried to cause Jesus to be released. But the Jews said, “Every man who calls himself saying I am king becomes opposed to the emperor. If you set him free, you are not the emperor's friend” they shouted.
\v 13 So Pilate, having heard these words, brought Jesus outside. He sat on the judgement telling seat on the raised platform. In the Jews' language\f * \fr 19:13 \ft The Jews used to speak the \nd Hebrew\nd* and \nd Aramaic\nd* languages.\f* that place is called ‘Gabbatha’.
\v 14 It was that Passover festival's day of doing preparation. At that time it was almost midday. So Pilate said, “Look! Your king” he told the Jews.
\v 15 Then they said, “Kill him! Kill him! Nail him on the log and kill him” they shouted. So Pilate said, “Why do you say that your king should be nailed on the log and killed?”. So the chief priests said, “Except for the emperor, we have no other king”.
\v 16 Then Pilate handed him over to the soldiers in order to nail him on a log and kill him. So they took Jesus.
\s Killing Jesus having nailed him on a log
\r (Matthew 27:32-44; Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43)
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus carried on shoulders his log and went to the place called the skull. In the Jews' language this is called ‘Golgotha’.
\v 18 There they struck with nails and hung him on the middle log. On Jesus' right side one man, and on the left side one man they struck with nails and hung on logs.
\v 19 Then Pilate, “\nd Jesus of Nazareth is king of the Jews\nd*” on a board\f * \fr 19:19 \ft If someone was caught doing wrong, the wrong-doer must take a log carrying it on the shoulders. Then in front of him will be written what wrong he did. Those who read that will know for what wrong they are striking with nails and killing him.\f* having caused to write, he caused them to nail it on the log that Jesus was hangin on.
\v 20 The place they hung Jesus on the log was close to the city. Due to that board being written in languages\f * \fr 19:20 \ft Many of the Jews would be able to read one of these languages.\f* called Hebrew, Latin and Greek, many Jews who came there for the festival were able to read it.
\v 21 Then the chief priests said, “Not ‘King of the Jews’, but cause to write that ‘He said I am the king of the Jews’” having gone to Pilate they told.
\v 22 Then Pilate said, “[What] I caused to write there, let it be like that [as] I caused to write”.
\p
\v 23 \fig |LB00328C.jpg|span|||Hanging Jesus on the log|19:23\fig* After the soldiers nailed Jesus on the log, they divided his garments having given each one portion of four portions. They also took his outer robe. That robe was long without stitching.\f * \fr 19:23 \ft Long ago they used to make these kinds of long robes without stitching.\f*
\v 24 So the soldiers said, “Let's not tear this. Whoever's name comes should take it” they drew lots. This happened to fulfil the word written in the \w scripture\w* “Having divided my clothes they will draw lots\x + \xo 19:24 \xt Psalms 22:18\xt*\x* to take my robe”. For that reason the soldiers did like this.
\p
\v 25 Near the log on which they nailed Jesus, Jesus' mother, his mother's-younger-sister, Clopas' wife Mary and Mary of Magdalene village were standing.
\v 26 Jesus, having seen his mother and his loved-one \w disciple|Disciples\w* standing nearby, said, “Look, mother! Your son”.
\v 27 And having looked towards that disciple said, “Look! Your mother”. From that time having taken her to his home, he looked after her as his own mother.
\s Jesus' releasing his life
\r (Matthew 27:45-56; Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49)
\p
\v 28 After that happened, having known that all his came-for work was finished, in order for that written in scripture to happen, “\wj I am thirsty\wj*”\x + \xo 19:28 \xt Psalms 69:21\xt*\x* like-that Jesus said.
\v 29 There was a pot there filled with fermented grape juice. So having soaked cotton (wool) in it, they hung it on a branch of the Hyssop tree and extended it to Jesus' mouth.
\v 30 Then Jesus, having tasted that juice, said, “I have finished the work I came for” having lowered his head, he died.
\p
\v 31 That was the day of preparation for the Passover festival. Due to the next day being a very auspicious Sabbath,\f * \fr 19:31 \fq Sabbath \ft according to the Jewish regulations it was not right for a body to be hanging on the cross on the Sabbath; and the work of removing the dead-body from the cross could not be done on the next day. Therefore this work had to be done before sunset.\f* the Jews did not like those bodies hanging on the logs. Therefore they said, “Having caused their legs to break,\f * \fr 19:31 \ft A person nailed on a log is able to breathe by pressing [up] on his legs. But when they break their legs, then due to not being able to breathe, they would quickly die.\f* cause those bodies to be taken down” they asked Pilate.
\v 32 So the soldiers having come, they broke the legs of the two people who were crucified along with Jesus.
\v 33 But having come to Jesus, having seen that he had died before that, they did not break his legs.
\v 34 But one of the soldiers from among them pierced Jesus' side with a spear. Immediately blood along with water flowed out.
\v 35 He who saw this testified so that you may put faith. His testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth.
\v 36-37 “Not even one bone from his bones will break”\x + \xo 19:36-37 \xt Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12; Psalms 34:20\xt*\x* and in another place “They will look to his side whom they pierced”\x + \xo 19:36-37 \xt Zechariah 12:10\x* like-that in the scripture it was written, in order for those words to be fulfilled it happened like this.
\s Putting Jesus body in a carved stone cave
\r (Matthew 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56)
\p
\v 38 A man called Joseph of Arimathea town, with fear of the Jews, was secretly devoted to Jesus. But now, having gone to Pilate said, “Allow me to take Jesus' dead-body”. So, due to Pilate agreeing, he took Jesus' dead-body.
\v 39 With this Joseph there was also Nicodemus [who] one night had come to Jesus. Nicodemus brought about thirty five kilos of sweet smelling things called bolam and agar to apply to the dead-body.
\v 40 According to the Jew's custom those two men together applied these things and wrapped Jesus' dead-body with expensive new hand-woven cloth.
\v 41 At the [same] place, where they had nailed and hung Jesus on the log, there was a garden. In that garden there was a carved, new rock cave-tomb. Until then no dead-body had been put in that.
\v 42 Due to that rock cave being close and that day being the Jew's Passover festival's preparation day, they hurriedly put Jesus dead-body in that carved rock cave-tomb.\f * \fr 19:42 \ft The Jewish rest Sabbath starts at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on Saturday. So according to their custom no person's body should be left without being buried. Therefore that work had to be done quickly.\f*

\s Jesus having died, rising (to life)
\r (Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12)
\p
\v 1 On the first day of the week, Sunday, very early in the morning while it was dark, Mary of Magdalene village went to the carved rock cave-tomb where Jesus' dead-body was put. So she saw that the rock blocking that cave-tomb had been rolled [aside].
\v 2 Therefore that Mary having run to Simon-Peter and another \w disciple|Disciples\w* that Jesus loved, said, “Some people have taken the Lord's dead-body from that cave-tomb and we don't know where they put [it]”.
\v 3 So Peter and the disciple with him left in order to see the cave-tomb.
\v 4 While those two were running together, that disciple having run ahead of Peter, he reached the cave-tomb.
\v 5 And from the outside he stooped and looked. So he only saw the wrapped-around cloths there. But he did not enter inside.
\v 6-7 Then Simon-Peter, having reached there, entered inside that cave-tomb. The cloths that [had been] wrapped-around the dead-body were there. He saw the cloth that [had been] wrapped around Jesus head, having been folded, was separate from the remaining cloths.
\v 8 Then the disciple who had reached the tomb first, having entered, having seen, he believed.
\v 9 Even then they were yet to understand the matter in \w scripture\w* that says, “Christ, having died, will surely rise [to life]”.
\v 10 Then those two went back to their own people.
\s Jesus appearing to Mary of Magdalene village
\r (Mark 16:9-11)
\p
\v 11 But Mary of Magdalene village was standing outside the cave-tomb crying. While crying like that she stooped and looked in from the outside.
\v 12 Then two of God's angels appeared wearing very white clothes. They were sitting where Jesus dead-body had been - one at the head end and one at the feet end.
\v 13 They said, “Sister! Why do you cry?”. So she said, “Some people having taken the Lord's dead-body from the cave-tomb, I don't know where they put [it]” Mary said.
\v 14 Having told like that, she turned around. Then she saw Jesus standing, but she did not recognize he was Jesus.
\v 15 \fig |cn01857c.jpg|col|||Jesus appearing to Mary|20:15\fig*Then Jesus said, “Older sister, why do you cry? And for whom are you searching?”. So Mary having thought that he was the garden's servant said, “Brother! If you have taken the Lord's dead-body, tell me where you have put him. Having gone, I will take the dead-body”.
\v 16 So Jesus said, “Mary!” he called her. Then Mary turned towards him and called out “Rabboni!” in the Hebrew language. The meaning of this is ‘religious teacher’.
\v 17 Jesus said with her said, “I must go to the father above. Don't stay holding me. But having gone to my younger-brothers, tell them, ‘My father is your father. My God is your God. I am going to the father above’” he said to her.
\v 18 So Mary of Magdalene village having gone to the disciples said, “I have seen the Lord. The Lord told me to say these things to you” she told the disciples.
\p
\v 19 On the evening of that day\f * \fr 20:19 \ft According to the Jewish custom, Saturday is called the rest day. For that week, that Saturday is the last day. Sunday becomes the first day of the new week.\f* having fear of the Jewish authorities, having closed and bolted the doors of the house where they were gathered, they were inside. Then Jesus appeared in their midst said, “May peace come to you” he told them.
\v 20 After saying like that, he showed his hands and side. So, having recognized the Lord, those disciples felt very happy.
\v 21 Then Jesus once again said, “May peace come to you! As the father sent me to the world, I also will send you to the world” he told the disciples.
\v 22 Having told like this, “You recieve the \w Holy Spirit\w*” he breathed out breath on them.\x + \xo 20:22 \xt Genesis 2:7\xt*\x*
\v 23 And “Whoever's sins you forgive, they will get forgiveness. Whoever's sins [you] do not forgive, they will not get forgiveness” he told them.
\s Jesus appearing to Thomas
\r (Matthew 28:16-20; Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49)
\p
\v 24 When Jesus had come, one of them from among the twelve disciples, the twin called Thomas, was not there.
\v 25 Therefore the disciples said, “We saw the Lord!” they told Thomas. But Thomas said, “Without having truly seen the holes from the nails hit into the Lord's hands and having touched them with my finger and without putting my hand in the side pierced with a spear, I will not believe at all”.
\p
\v 26 One week after having said like that, the disciples were in a house. Then Thomas was with them. While the doors were closed and locked, Jesus appeared to them (and said), “May peace come to you!”.
\v 27 After saying like that, to Thomas he said, “Touch with your fingers and see my hands. And having stretched out your hand, put [it] in my side and without being like a faithless one, be one with faith”.
\v 28 Then Thomas said, “Yes, my God! My Lord!” he answered Jesus.
\v 29 So Jesus said, “You believed having seen me. Those who believe without seeing will get many blessings” he told Thomas.
\s The purpose of this book
\p
\v 30 Apart from these, Jesus did many other miraculous deeds in front of the disciples. Those are not written in this book.
\v 31 But these things have been written so that if you will believe that Jesus is the saving one Christ\f * \fr 20:31 \fq the saving one Christ \ft In the Hebrew language, they say Messaiah. It's meaning is the king that God appointed and was sending in order to save the people. The Jews were looking for him.\f* and he is God's son, you will get eternal life.

\s Jesus appearing to seven disciples
\p
\v 1 After that happened, Jesus once again appeared to his \w disciples\w* in this way on the shore of the sea of Galilee \f * \fr 21:1 \ft They also call it the Sea of Tiberias.\f*
\v 2 Simon-Peter, the twin called Thomas, Nathaniel of Galilee area's town of Cana, Zebedee's sons and two other from among Jesus' disciples were gathered together.
\v 3 Then Simon-Peter said, “I am going to catch fish” he said to them. So they said, “We will also come with you”. And having gone, they sat in the boat, but that night they did not catch anything.
\p
\v 4 While the sun was rising, Jesus was standing on the shore, but those disciples did not recognize him.
\v 5 Then Jesus said, “You brothers! Have you caught fish to eat?”. So they said, “Did not catch”.
\v 6 \fig |CN01875C.jpg|col|||Many fish caught in the net|21:6\fig* So Jesus said, “You put your net on the boat's right side. Then fish will be caught”. So they threw the net as were told. Then very many fish were caught. So they were unable to lift that net onto the boat.
\v 7 Then the disciple that Jesus loved said, “He is the Lord!” he told Peter. So Simon-Peter having heard that, due to being top-half-naked, immediately having put on his shirt, he jumped into the sea in order to go to the shore.
\v 8 Due to the remaining disciples being two hundred cubits from the shore, they came by that boat pulling the net of caught fish.
\p
\v 9 After the boat reached the shore, they got down. Then they saw some bread and fish on the burning-coals.
\v 10 Then Jesus said, “Now you bring some from among the caught fish”.
\v 11 So Simon-Peter having gone to the boat, and held the rope, pulled the net from the water to the shore. The net was full of one hundred and fifty three big fish. But even then that net did not rip.
\v 12 Then Jesus said, “Come and eat!” he called the disciples. So due to [them] coming to know that he is the Lord, ‘Who are you?’ like-that no one asked him.
\v 13 So Jesus shared bread and fish with them.
\v 14 After Jesus' death and rising [to life], this was the third time he appeared to the disciples.
\s Jesus Restoring Peter's backslidden faith
\p
\v 15 After their eating, Jesus said, “John's son Simon! Do you love me more than these [people] do?” he asked Simon-Peter. So he said, “Yes Lord! You know that I love” Peter said. So Jesus said, “Look after my sheep\x + \xo 21:15 \xt John 10:1-15\xt*\x*”.
\v 16 Once more Jesus said, “John's son Simon! Do you really love me?”. So he said, “Yes Lord! You know that I love” Peter said. So Jesus said, “Look after my sheep”.
\v 17 The third time Jesus said, “John's son Simon! Do you really love me?”. Due to being asked ‘Do you love me?’ a third time, Peter said with sadness, “Yes Lord! You know everything. You also know that I love you”. So Jesus said, “Look after my sheep” he told Peter.
\v 18 And, “This is true. While you are a young-man, having tied your [clothes at your] waist, you go wherever you like. But after you become an old-man, while your hands, are stretched out, someone else having tied, will take you where you don't like to go” Jesus told.
\v 19 Jesus said like this in order to show what kind of death having happened [to him, by which he] would bring glory to God. After saying like that he said, “Follow according to my way”.
\p
\v 20 While they were eating the Passover meal, the one who leaned even closer to the Lord, and asked ‘Lord! Who is it?’, the disciple Jesus loved, Peter saw [him] following behind.
\v 21 Having seen him, Peter asked, “Lord! What will happen to him?” he asked Jesus.
\v 22 So Jesus [told Peter], “If I want him to remain until I come once again, you don't need to know about that matter. You, just follow according to my way”.
\v 23 Through that, the message that that disciple won't die spread among the believers. But Jesus didn't say like that about the loved disciple. He just said, “If I want him to remain until I come once again, you don't need to know about that matter”.
\s Final message
\p
\v 24 This disciple, the one who Jesus loved, having seen all these events, in order to tell witness wrote all these things. We know that his testimony is true.
\v 25 There are even more deeds that Jesus did on earth. I think that if each one from them were explained, there would be insufficient place to keep those books in this world.
