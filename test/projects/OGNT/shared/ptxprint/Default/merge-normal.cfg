# Custom merge configuration file.
# This was written because no merge-normal.cfg file could be found.
# As generated it contains all potential break-points the program expects,
# with settings appropriate for the 'normal' merge. Customisation of
# this file can entirely change the behaviour of merge strategy 'normal'
#(delete file to reverse any customisation)
#
# YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! 
# 
# Items in the [FLAGS] section (if specified) are global values, affecting the
# entire merge process, and override the defaults, including such matters as
# whether verses are synchronisation points or not.
#
# Items in the [DEFAULT] section define the global defaults, which apply if
# there are no overriding values in a given section.  Valid sections include
# [L] and [R] (primary and secondary), [configuration], and [variety] for
# custom-variety.
# Sections [L] and [R] are ignored if the file is in the root paratext
# directory.  The scores (from all columns) are added and a sum of 100 or more
# at a given point causes splitting and synchronisation.
# Any value not listed is assumed to be 0.
# Values -2<=x<=2 are treated as multiplyers of the WEIGHT value.  Other values
# are treated as absolute values. Non-integer values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
# Chapter and verse numbers are remembered, other break-points increment a
# paragraph counter.
