\v  1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
\v  2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
\v  3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\v  4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
\v  5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing
their sins.
\v  6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
\v  7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
\v  8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
\v  9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
\v  10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
\v  11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\v  12 And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

\v  15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
\v  16 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
\v  17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
\v  18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
\v  19 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their
nets.
\v  20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
\v  21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
\v  22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
\v  23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
